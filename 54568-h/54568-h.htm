<h2><em>PREFACE</em></h2>


<p><em>In preparing the following pages for publication, it
has been my object to present a collection of recipes and
lessons on food, for the use of nurses. The idea was
suggested by the need of such a book in the training-school
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. It is hoped
that it will be found useful in other hospitals and
schools where the teaching of the subject of food is
receiving attention, and also to those who care for their
own sick and invalid ones at home.</em></p>

<p><em>Part I&mdash;the explanatory lessons&mdash;includes general
remarks on chemistry, lessons on the properties of the
different classes of foods, and special articles on Air,
Water, Milk, Digestion and Nutrition. Part II consists
of recipes, menus of liquid, light, and convalescent's
diet, and articles on Serving, Feeding of Children, and
District Nursing.</em></p>

<p><em>In arranging the explanatory lessons, information has
been drawn from many sources, but particularly from
the works of Atwater and Parkes. It is the intention
that these lessons be studied in connection with the
practical work; they contain matter suggestive of that
which it is necessary to understand in order that something
may be known of the complex changes which take
place in food in the various processes of cooking.</em></p>

<p><em>The recipes have been carefully chosen and perfected,
some having been changed many times before final adoption.
In most of them the quantities are small,&mdash;such
amounts as would be required for one person,&mdash;but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
multiplying or dividing the formulæ any quantity may
be made, with uniform results.</em></p>

<p><em>Detailed descriptions have been given in order that
those who know nothing of cooking may be able, by intelligently
following the instructions, to make acceptable
dishes. Repetition and similarity of arrangement will,
it is hoped, serve to impress upon the mind certain
points and principles.</em></p>

<p><em>In some instances the recipes are original, but for the
most part the ideas have been gathered from lessons and
lectures on cooking, and from standard books, among
them Mrs. Lincoln's "Boston Cook Book." Generally the
order in which each recipe has been written is the order
in which the different ingredients should be put together.
The proportions have been placed first, and separately
from the description of the process, for greater convenience
in using.</em></p>

<p><em>Valuable information for the chapter on the feeding
of children was found in Uffelmann's "Hygiene of the
Child."</em></p>

<p><em>I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Drs. Simon
Flexner and William D. Booker of the Johns Hopkins
Hospital in reviewing, respectively, the explanatory lessons
and the chapter on the feeding of children.</em></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">The work of the nurse is to care for her patient,
to watch, to tend, and to nurture him in such
a way that he shall gain and maintain sufficient
strength to overcome disease, that he may finally be
restored to a state of health. Her greatest allies in
this work consist in the proper hygienic surroundings
of good air, warmth, cleanliness, and proper
nourishment.</p>

<p>The most scrupulous cleanliness in the care and
preparation of food is an important point in her
work, and practically to appreciate this, some knowledge
of bacteriology is necessary, for the various fermentative
and putrefactive changes (often unnoticed)
which take place in both cooked and uncooked foods
are caused by the growth of microscopic forms of life.
Most of us realize the necessity for removing all visible
impurities, but that is not enough; we should also
combat those unseen agents which are everywhere at
work, in order that we may prevent their action upon
food material or destroy the products of their growth.
Often these products are of a poisonous nature, and
cause grave physical disturbances when they occur in
our foods. When such knowledge is more general, we
shall have arrived at a state of progress in the care
and preparation of foods not yet universally reached.</p>

<p>The indications at present are that nothing of importance
will be done to change for the better the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
existing methods of housekeeping, until housekeepers
are educated in the science of household affairs.
They should comprehend (1) that the atmosphere is
an actual thing; that it has characteristics and properties
like other actual things; that it is a necessity
of life, and may be made a medium for the transmission
of disease; and that it is as necessary that it
should be kept clean as the floor, the table, or the
furniture; (2) that food is a subject which may be
studied and mastered like any other subject; that the
changes it undergoes in its care and preparation are
governed by fixed laws; (3) they should have a
knowledge of heat in order to appreciate the effects of
temperature on different food materials, to regulate
the ventilation of their houses, and to control fires
wisely and economically; and (4) they should have
some knowledge of bacteriology, that milk and water,
flesh, fruit, and vegetables may be kept, or rendered,
absolutely free from disease-giving properties, and
that perfect cleanliness may be exercised in preparing
all materials that enter the body as nutrients.</p>

<p>It is not the intention to imply that all micro-organisms
produce injurious effects wherever they
are found; on the contrary, they are as essential to
man's existence as are the higher forms of life; but
often they seriously, even fatally, interfere with that
existence, and in order to discriminate and to combat
the evil a knowledge of their ways and modes of life
is essential.</p>

<p>A Harvard professor is credited with saying that
no man could be a gentleman without a knowledge of
chemistry; and forthwith all the students took to
chemistry, for all wanted to be gentlemen. Would
that somebody would authoritatively declare that no
woman could be a lady without a knowledge of the
chemistry of the household&mdash;what a glorious prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
would there be opened for the future health of the
nation!</p>

<p>We read in history that after a grand medieval
repast the bones and refuse of the feast were thrown
under the table and left to decay. The scourges
which have swept over Europe in past centuries we
know, to-day, were not visitations of Providence, but
were simply the result of natural causes, due to ignorance
of all hygienic laws on the part of the people.
Compared with the barbarians of old, in these matters,
we are a civilized people; compared with the possibilities
of the future, we are still little more than savages.</p>

<p>The ideal life is one in which there shall be no sickness
except from accident or natural causes. When
we have mastered the laws of hygiene, then will such
life be possible. Meanwhile, with sickness always in
our midst, we should keep the ideal ever before us,
and endeavor by all means to restore suffering human
beings to a perfect state of health. A sound
body is a material thing, prosaically nourished by
material substances, which produce just as exact results
in its chemical physiology as if those substances
entered into combination in the laboratory of the
chemist. The cooking of food should be governed
by exact laws which for the most part as yet remain
undemonstrated. It is a foregone conclusion
that many young women fail in their first attempts
at cooking; that they do so is not surprising, for
not only are their friends unable to teach them, but
the majority of books on the subject furnish no
intelligible aid.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The science of cookery is still in
the empirical stage.</p>

<p>Even among experienced housekeepers there is
not enough knowledge of the nature of foods and
their proper combinations; the result is a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of unwholesome cookery and the consequent injury
and waste which must follow. Dislike for the work
is usually due to want of success, and failure is attributed
to ill luck, poor materials, the fire, or any cause
but the true one&mdash;which is ignorance of the subject.
Of course good dishes cannot be made out of poor
materials, but too often poor dishes are made out of
good materials.</p>

<p>The systematic teaching of the subject of household
affairs cannot fail of good results. Especially
is this true in the case of the nurse, who will need at
all times to exercise care and wisdom in the choice of
food for the sick, to avoid the use of injurious substances,
and to select that which is perfectly wholesome
and suited to the needs and condition of each
individual.</p>

<p>It may be said that most women can prepare a
fairly satisfactory meal for those who are well, but
very few are able to do the same for the sick.</p>

<p>Count Rumford says: "I constantly found that the
richness or quality of a soup depended more upon
the proper choice of ingredients than upon the quantity
of solid nutrient matter employed; much more
upon the art and skill of the cook than upon sums
laid out in the market." This is equally true of other
dishes than soup. The skill to develop the natural
flavors of a food, to render it perfectly and thoroughly
digestible, to convert it into a delicate viand, cannot
be acquired in a haphazard way. Cooking cannot
be done by guesswork. There are right and wrong
methods in the kitchen as well as in the laboratory,
and there is no doubt that the awakening interest in
the subject of domestic science generally is neither
an accident nor a whim, but the result of a necessity
for better ways of living. We live different lives
from those of our grandfathers before the days of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
steam-engine, electricity, the telegraph, and the telephone.
Now much more energy is needed to meet
each day's demand than was required a hundred years
ago, and so, much more nutriment is needed to sustain
that energy. When the food does not supply
the material to meet the demand, the whole being
suffers.</p>

<p>A course of study in cooking taken by the nurses
of a hospital, while they are still pupils, is valuable
for their present and future work. A nurse with the
information that such a course should give, will be able
to care for the feeding of her patients more wisely,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> will
see the necessity for variety, will learn to avoid suspicious
substances, such as fermented meat or fish, canned
foods, etc., and will put forth every effort to secure
that which is appetizing and wholesome, and suited to
the needs of those in her care. She will more easily
exercise patience and forbearance with the idiosyncrasies
of the sick in regard to articles of diet, knowing
that these are usually the symptoms of disease. The
proper modes of caring for milk, eggs, oysters, and
other perishable foods, the practice of economy in the
use of wines, cocoa, and like costly substances, and an
appreciation of the value of food materials in general,
are some of the points which she will have learned.</p>

<p>She will not forget that cleanliness in the kitchen
in the preparation of all food, and in the washing of
dishes, towels, waste-pails, sinks, and all receptacles
in which easily decomposing substances are kept,
means protection against many evils. The little
knowledge of bacteriology that it is possible to give
in a course in cooking, will enable her to understand
that many animal foods, such as oysters, fish, and lobsters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
are extremely prone to decay, and, although
<em>apparently</em> good, may have been the camping-ground
of millions of organisms which have produced such
changes in them as to render them suspicious articles
of diet. She will, therefore, always endeavor to
have such food alive if possible, or at least fresh, and
to keep it in such conditions of temperature as shall
preserve it in a wholesome state.</p>

<p>The actual practical knowledge of how a certain
number of dishes should be made has, of course, its
value; but it is not the only consideration which
should enter into the teaching of cookery. Perhaps
the most important point in all such work is the recognition
in certain cases of the <em>necessity</em> for particular
dishes, and the reasons for, and the value of, their
ingredients. Why one kind of food is better for one
person and a different kind for another is, without
doubt, an essential point in all such study.</p>

<p>A system depleted by disease, exhausted by long-continued
illness, is an exceedingly delicate instrument
to handle. It requires the greatest wisdom and good
judgment on the part of physician and nurse to
restore a patient to health without a lingering convalescence.
There is no doubt that the period of
convalescence may be much shortened by the wise administration
of food, and that the subsequent health
of the patient may be either made or marred by the
action of the nurse in this respect.</p>

<h3>PREPARATION OF FOOD</h3>

<p><b>Digestibility.</b> There are comparatively few kinds
of food that can be eaten uncooked. Various fruits,
milk, oysters, eggs, and some other things may be
eaten raw, but the great mass of food materials must
be prepared by some method of cooking. All the common
vegetables, such as potatoes, turnips, carrots,
beets, and the different grains, such as rice, wheat,
corn, oats, etc., neither taste good nor are easily digestible
until their starch, cellulose, and other constituents
have been changed from their compact indigestible
form by the action of heat. Some one has
spoken of cooking as a sort of artificial digestion,
by which nature is relieved of a certain amount of
work which it would be very difficult, if not impossible,
for her to perform.</p>

<p><b>Flavors.</b> The necessity of cooking to develop, or to
create, a palatable taste is important. The flesh of
fowl is soft enough to masticate, but only a person on
the verge of starvation could eat it until heat has
changed its taste and made it one of the most savory
and acceptable of meats. Coffee also well illustrates
this point. When coffee is green&mdash;that is, unbrowned&mdash;it
is acrid in taste, very tough, even horny in consistency,
and a decoction made from it is altogether unpleasant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
But when it is subjected to a certain degree
of heat, for a certain time, it loses its toughness,
becomes brittle, changes color, and there is developed
in it a most agreeable flavor. This flavoring property
is an actual product of the heat, which causes chemical
changes in an essential oil contained in the bean.
Heat not only develops but creates flavors, changing
the odor and taste as well as the digestibility of food.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Cold.</b> Some foods are better for being
cold; for example, butter, honey, salads, and ice-cream.
Sweet dishes as a rule are improved by a low temperature.
The flavor of butter is very different and very
much finer when cold than when warm. It is absolutely
necessary to keep it cool in order to preserve
the flavor.</p>


<p class="p1x" />
<h3>CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHANGES</h3>

<p><b>Chemical Changes.</b> Since many of the changes which
cooking produces in the different food materials are
of a chemical nature, it is well to consider what constitutes
a chemical process. This idea may perhaps
be best conveyed by a few experiments and illustrations,
the materials for which may be easily obtained.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp. with Cream of Tartar and Bicarbonate of Soda.</b>
Mix two teaspoons of cream of tartar with one of bicarbonate
of soda, in a little warm water. A union of the two substances
follows and they neutralize each other; that is, the
cream of tartar is no longer acid, and the soda is no longer alkaline.
Owing to the power of chemical affinities a separation or
breaking up of these compounds takes place, and new substances,
<em>carbonic acid</em> and <em>rochelle salts</em>, are formed out of their
constituents. The effervescence which is seen is caused by the
escape of the carbonic acid.</p>

<p><b>Exp. with Hydrochloric Acid and Soda.</b> Put a few drops
of chemically pure hydrochloric acid into a little water; then
add soda. A violent effervescence will follow. Continue putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in soda until this ceases, when the reaction should be neutral.
Test it with litmus-paper. If it turns blue litmus-paper red, it
is acid; if red litmus-paper blue, it is alkaline. Add acid or
soda, whichever is required, until there is no change produced
in either kind of litmus-paper. The results of this experiment
are similar to those in the first one, namely, carbonic acid and a
salt. In this case the salt is <em>sodium chlorid</em> or <em>common salt</em>,
which is in solution in the liquid. Evaporate the water, when
salt crystals will be found.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><b>Oxid of Iron.</b> A piece of iron when exposed to the weather
becomes covered with a brownish-yellow coating, which does
not look at all like the original metal. If left long enough it
will wholly disappear, being completely changed into the yellowish
substance, which is <em>oxid of iron</em>, a compound of oxygen
and iron, commonly called <em>iron rust</em>.</p>

<p><b>Burning of Coal.</b> A piece of coal burns in the grate and is
apparently destroyed, leaving no residue except a little ashes.
The carbon and hydrogen of the coal have united with the oxygen
of the air, the result of which is largely the invisible gas,
<em>carbonic acid</em>, which escapes through the chimney.</p>

<p><b>Formation of Water.</b> Water is formed by the union of two
invisible gases, hydrogen and oxygen. It bears no resemblance
whatever to either of them. Its symbol is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<p>All these are examples of chemical changes.</p>

<p><b>Definition of Chemical Change.</b> Chemical changes
or processes may be defined as those close and intimate
actions amongst the particles of matter by
which they are dissociated or decomposed, or by
which new compounds are formed, and involving
a complete loss of identity of the original substance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Physical Changes.</b> Mix a teaspoon of sugar with an equal
amount of salt; the sugar is still sugar, and the salt remains
salt; and they may each be separated from the mixture as such.</p>

<p>Water when frozen is changed from a liquid to a solid; its
chemical composition, however, remains unchanged.</p>

<p>Water converted into steam by heat is changed from a liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to a gas, but chemically there is no difference between the one
and the other. <em>Steam</em>, <em>water</em>, and <em>ice</em> are forms of the same substance,
the difference being physical, not chemical, and caused
by a difference in temperature.</p>

<p>Lead melted so that it will run, and the solid lead of a bullet,
are the same thing.</p></div>

<p>These illustrate physical changes.</p>

<p><b>Definition.</b> When substances are brought together
in such a way that their characteristic qualities remain
the same, the change is called physical. It is less
close and intimate than a chemical change. The transition
from one state into another is also frequently
only a physical change, as is seen in the transformation
of water into steam, water into ice, etc.</p>


<p class="p1x" />
<h3>ELEMENTS</h3>

<p>One feature of the work of the chemist is to separate
compound bodies into their simple constituents.
These constituents he also endeavors to dissociate;
and if this cannot be done by any means known to
him, then the thing must be regarded as a simple
substance. Such simple bodies are called <em>elements</em>.</p>

<p><b>Definition.</b> An element then may be defined as a
simple substance, which cannot by any known process
be transformed into anything else; that is, no
matter how it is treated, it still remains chemically
what it was before. Gold, silver, copper, iron, platinum,
carbon, phosphorus, calcium, oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen, and chlorin are examples of elements. Once
it was believed that there were but four elements in
the world&mdash;earth, air, fire, and water. Then it was
learned that these were not elements at all, but compounds,
and the number of elements increased, until
now sixty-eight are admitted to be simple primary
substances. Some of these may in the future be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
proven to be compounds. Sulphur is at present in
the doubtful list.</p>

<p><b>Oxygen.</b> Oxygen is an element. It is an invisible
gas, without taste or smell. It is the most abundant
substance in the world, and an exceedingly active
agent, entering into nearly all chemical changes and
forming compounds with all known elements except
one&mdash;fluorin. It is a necessity of life and of combustion.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
It constitutes about two thirds of the weight
of our bodies and one fifth of the weight of the air.</p>

<p><b>Hydrogen.</b> Hydrogen is a gas. It is the lightest
substance known. It unites with oxygen to form
water, and, as will be seen later, enters into the composition
of the human body.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><b>Nitrogen.</b> Nitrogen is also a gas, but, unlike oxygen,
is an inactive element. It supports neither fire nor
life. It is not poisonous, however, for we breathe it
constantly in the atmosphere, where its office is to
dilute the too active oxygen. A person breathing it
in a pure state dies simply from lack of oxygen.</p>

<p><b>Carbon.</b> Carbon is a solid and an important and
abundant element. It is known under three forms:
diamond, graphite, and charcoal. The diamond is
nearly pure carbon. Graphite (the "black-lead" of
lead-pencils), coal, coke, and charcoal are impure forms
of it. Carbon is combustible; that is, it burns or
combines with oxygen. In this union carbonic acid
is formed, and there is an evolution of heat, and
usually, if the union be rapid and intense enough, of
light. It is the valuable element in fuels, and in the
body of man it unites with the oxygen of the air,
yielding heat, to keep the body warm, and energy or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
muscular strength for work (Prof. Atwater). The
carbonic acid formed in the body is given out by
the lungs and skin.</p>

<p><b>Other Elements.</b> There are many other elements
about which it would be interesting to note something,
such as calcium and phosphorus (found abundantly
in the bones), magnesium, sulphur, sodium,
iron, etc. Samples of these may be obtained to show to
pupils, and descriptions given and experiments made,
at the discretion of the teacher. Of the four most
abundant elements of the body and of food,&mdash;oxygen,
carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen,&mdash;it is extremely important
that some study be made, and if the apparatus
can be procured, that it be of an experimental nature
rather than simply descriptive.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>


<p class="p1x" />
<h3>AIR</h3>

<p>Air is made up principally of two elements, nitrogen
and oxygen. It also always contains vapor of
water and carbonic acid. Its average composition is
as follows:</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Nitrogen</td><td class="tdrx">78.49%</td><td class="tdl pad2 bl">Aqueous Vapor</td><td class="tdrx">.84%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Oxygen</td><td class="tdrx">20.63%</td><td class="tdl pad2 bl">Carbonic Acid</td><td class="tdrx">.04%</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>These are mixed together, not <em>chemically united</em>.
Oxygen and nitrogen do unite chemically, but not in
the proportions in which they exist in the air. Nitrous
Oxid (N<sub>2</sub>O), sometimes called "Laughing Gas," is
one of the compounds of nitrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h3>FIRE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp. with a Candle.</b> Take a tallow candle, and by means
of a lighted match raise its temperature sufficiently high to
start an action between the carbon in the candle and the oxygen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the air; in other words, light the candle. A match is composed
of wood, sulphur, and phosphorus. The latter is a substance
which unites with oxygen very easily; that is, at a <em>low
temperature</em>. By friction against any hard object, sufficient heat
is aroused to effect a union between the phosphorus of a match
and the oxygen of the surrounding air; the flame is then conveyed
to the sulphur, or the heat thus generated causes a union
between it (the sulphur) and the oxygen, sulphur burning somewhat
less freely than phosphorus; this gives enough heat to ignite
the wood, and with its combustion we get sufficient heat to light
the candle, or to start a chemical union between the combustible
portion, carbon chiefly, of the candle and the oxygen of
the air. Allow the candle to burn for a time, then put over it
a tall lamp-chimney; notice that the flame grows long and dim.
Next place on the top of the chimney a tin cover, leaving a
small opening, and make an opening into the chimney from below,
with a pin or the blade of a knife placed between it and
the table; note that the candle burns dimly. Then exclude the
flow of air by completely covering the top; in a moment, as
soon as the oxygen inside the chimney is consumed, the candle
will go out.</p></div>

<p>This shows (1) that air&mdash;in other words, oxygen&mdash;is
necessary to cause the candle to burn; (2) that by
regulating the draft or flow of air the intensity of
the combustion may be increased or diminished; (3)
that by completely excluding air the candle is extinguished.
This experiment with the candle illustrates
the way in which coal is consumed in a stove.
By opening the drafts and allowing the inflow of
plenty of oxygen, combustion is increased; by partially
closing them it is diminished, and by the complete
exclusion of air burning is stopped.</p>

<p>The products of the burning of coal are carbonic
acid and a small amount of ash. Twelve weights of
coal, not counting the ash, will unite with thirty-two
weights of oxygen, giving as a result forty-four weights
of carbonic acid. Accompanying the union there is an
evolution of light and heat. The enormous amount
of carbonic acid given out daily from fires is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
up by plants and used by them for food. In the
course of ages these plants may become coal, be consumed
in combustion, and, passing into the air, thus
complete the cycle of change.</p>

<p><b>Fuel and Kindlings.</b> The common fuels are coal,
coke, wood, gas, coal-oil, and peat. For kindling,
newspaper is good because, being made of straw
and wood-pulp, it burns easily, and also because
printers' ink contains turpentine, which is highly
inflammable.</p>

<h3>COMPOSITION OF THE BODY</h3>

<p>Before entering upon the study of foods it is well
to consider the composition of the human body, that
some idea of its chemical nature may be gained. In
the United States National Museum at Washington
may be found some interesting information on this
subject. From there much that is contained in the
following pages is taken.</p>

<p>A complete analysis of the human body has never
been made, but different organs have been examined,
and chemists have weighed and analyzed portions of
them, and from such data of this nature as could be
obtained, estimates of the probable composition of the
body have been calculated. Thirteen elements united
into their compounds, of which there are more than
one hundred, form it.</p>

<p>The following table gives the average composition
of a man weighing 148 pounds.</p>

and nitrogen constitute nearly the whole, the
other elements being in very small proportions.</p>

<p>Now, since the body is composed of these substances,
our food, including air and water, should
contain them all in due proportion, that the growth,
energy, and repair of the body may be healthfully
maintained.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h3>THE FIVE FOOD PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p>For convenience of comparison foods may be divided
into five classes: Water, Protein, Fats, Carbohydrates,
Mineral Matters.</p>

<p>Some scientists include air in the list, but it has
been thought best in this work to speak of it separately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
as the greatest necessity of life, but not in the
sense of a direct nutrient.</p>

<p>An average composition of three of the principles
is as follows:</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that the protein
compounds contain nitrogen; the fats and carbohydrates
do not.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h4>WATER</h4>

<p>We will now consider the first of the food principles&mdash;water.
Water is one of the necessities of
life. A person could live without air but a few minutes,
without water but a few days. It constitutes
by weight three fifths of the human body, and enters
largely into all organic matter. Water is an aid to
the performance of many of the functions of the body,
holding in solution the various nutritious principles,
and also acting as a carrier of waste. It usually contains
foreign matter, but the nearer it is to being
pure the more valuable it becomes as an agent in the
body. Ordinary hydrant, well, or spring water may
be made pure by filtering and then sterilizing it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp.</b> Put a little water into a test-tube, and heat it over the
flame of an alcohol-lamp. In a short time tiny bubbles will appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
on the sides of the glass. These are not steam, as may be proved
by testing the temperature of the water; they are bubbles of
atmospheric gases which have been condensed in the water
from the air; they have been proved to be nitrogen, oxygen,
and carbonic acid, but as they do not exist in the water in the
same proportions as in the air, they are not called <em>air</em>, but <em>atmospheric
gases</em>. Continue the heating, and the bubbles will continue
to form. After a while, very large bubbles will appear at
the bottom of the tube; they increase rapidly and rise toward
the top; some break before reaching it, but as the heat becomes
more intense others succeed in getting to the surface,&mdash;there they
break and disappear. If the water now be tested with a thermometer,
it will be found to have reached 212° Fahrenheit or
100° Centigrade, provided the experiment be tried at or near
the level of the sea.</p></div>

<p><b>Steam.</b> The large bubbles are bubbles of steam, or
water expanded by heat until its particles are so far
apart that it ceases to be a liquid and becomes a gas.
True steam is invisible; the moisture which collects
on the sides of the tube and is seen coming out at the
mouth is partially condensed steam, or watery vapor.
Watch a tea-kettle as it boils on a stove; for the space
of an inch or two from the end of the spout there
seems to be nothing; that is where the <em>true</em> steam is;
beyond that, clouds of what is commonly called steam
appear; they are watery vapor formed from the true
steam by partial condensation which is produced by
its contact with the cool air.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><b>Boiling-point of Water.</b> Water boils at different temperatures,
according to the elevation above the sea-level.
In Baltimore it boils practically at 212° Fahr.;
at Munich in Germany at 209½°; at the city of Mexico
in Mexico at 200°; and in the Himalayas, at an
elevation of 18,000 feet above the level of the sea, at
180°. These differences are caused by the varying
pressure of the atmosphere at these points. In Baltimore
practically the whole weight of the air is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
overcome. In Mexico, 7000 feet above the sea, there
are 7000 feet less of atmosphere to be resisted; consequently,
less heat is required, and boiling takes place
at a lower temperature. By inclosing a vessel of water
in a glass bell, and exhausting the air by means of an
air-pump, water may be made to boil at a temperature
of 70° Fahr., showing that much of the force (heat)
that is consumed in causing water to be converted into
steam is required to overcome the pressure of the air.
The foregoing illustrates the point that <em>boiling water</em>
is not of invariable temperature; consequently, that
foods which in some places are cooked in it may in
other places be cooked in water that is not boiling,&mdash;in
other words, that it is not ebullition which produces
the change in boiling substances, but heat.</p>

<p><b>Changes Produced in Water by Boiling.</b> By boiling
water for a moderate time the greater part of the atmospheric
gases is driven off. The flavor is much
changed. We call it "flat"; but by shaking it in a
carafe or other vessel so that the air can mingle with
it, it will reacquire oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic
acid, and its usual flavor can thus be restored.</p>

<p>Water which flows through soil containing lime is
further changed by boiling.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp. with Lime-water.</b> Pour a little lime-water into a
test-tube. With a small glass tube blow into it for a few minutes,
when it will become milky; continue the blowing for a few
minutes more, when it will lose its cloudy appearance and become
clear again. The following explains this: in the first
place there was forced into the lime-water, from the lungs, air
containing an excess of carbonic acid; this united with the
lime in solution in the water and formed carbonate of lime.
Carbonate of lime is insoluble in water which contains no carbonic
acid, or very little,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but will dissolve in water which is
charged with it, and this is produced by the continued blowing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Now if this water be freed of its excess of carbonic acid by boiling,
the carbonate of lime will be freed from its soluble state,
and will fall as a precipitate and settle on the sides of the vessel.
From this we learn that water may be freed from carbonate of
lime in solution in it by boiling.</p></div>

<p><b>Organic Matter in Water.</b> There is another class of
impurities in water of vastly more importance than
either the atmospheric gases or lime. These are the organic
substances which it always contains, especially
that which has flowed over land covered with vegetation,
or that which has received the drainage from
sewers. The soluble matter found in such water is
excellent food for many kinds of micro-organisms
which often form, by their multiplication, poisons
very destructive to animal life. Or the organisms
themselves may be the direct producers of disease, as
for instance the typhoid fever bacillus, the bacillus of
cholera, and probably others which occur in drinking-water.
These organisms are destroyed by heat, so
that the most valuable effect produced in water by
boiling it is their destruction. Such water is, therefore,
a much safer drink to use than that which has
not been boiled. Water should always be boiled if
there is the slightest suspicion of dangerous impurities
in the supply.</p>

<p><b>Use of Tea and Coffee.</b> This leads us to the thought
that the extensive use of tea and coffee in the world
may be an instinctive safeguard against these until
recently unknown forms of life. The universal use
of cooked water in some form in China is a matter
of history. The country is densely populated, the
sewage is carried off principally by the rivers, so that
the danger of contracting disease through water must
be very great, and it is probable that instinct or
knowledge has prompted the Chinaman to use but
very little water for food except that which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
cooked. Whatever the reason, the custom is a national
one. The every-day drink is weak tea made in
a large teapot and kept in a wadded basket to retain
the heat; the whole family use it. The very poor
drink plain hot water or water just tinged with tea.</p>

<p>That tea and coffee furnish us each day with a certain
amount of wholesome liquid in which all organic
life has been destroyed, remains a fact; they may
be, in addition, when <em>properly made</em> and of <em>proper
strength</em>, of great value on account of their warmth,
good flavor, and invigorating properties. There is
no doubt that it is of the greatest importance that tea
and coffee be used of <em>proper strength</em>; for if taken too
strong, disorders of the system may be produced,
necessitating their discontinuance, and thus depriving
the individual of a certain amount of warm and
wholesome liquid.</p>

<p><b>To Summarize.</b> The effects produced in water by
boiling which have been spoken of are: (1) the expulsion
of the atmospheric gases; (2) the precipitation of
lime when in solution; and (3) the destruction of
micro-organisms. The most important points to remember
in connection with water are, that a certain
amount each day is an absolute necessity of life, and
that unless the supply be above suspicion it should
be filtered and then sterilized.</p>

<p><b>Filtration and Sterilization of Water.</b> Filtration as
a general thing is done by public authorities, but
sterilization is not, and should be done when necessary
by the nurse. For immediate use, simply boiling
is said on good authority to be sufficient to
destroy all <em>organisms</em> then in the water. <em>Spores</em> of
organisms are, however, not killed by boiling, as they
are very resistant to heat. Fortunately they are not
common. As they do not develop into bacteria for
some hours after the water has been boiled, they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
be entirely gotten rid of by allowing them to develop
and then destroying by a second boiling; but for
all practical purposes, and under ordinary circumstances,
water is rendered safe for use by boiling it
once.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Should the water be very bad, boil it in a
jar plugged with cotton for half an hour three days
in succession, keeping it meanwhile in a temperature
of 70° or 80° Fahr., so that any <em>spores</em> of organisms
which may be in it will have an opportunity to get
into such a state of existence that they will be capable
of being killed by the next boiling. The third
treatment is for the purpose of making sure of any
that may have escaped the first and second.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h4>PROTEIN</h4>

<p>The second of the food principles, protein, is a
complex and very important constituent of our food.
The protein compounds differ from all others as to
chemical composition by the presence of nitrogen;
they contain <em>carbon</em>, <em>oxygen</em>, <em>hydrogen</em>, and <em>nitrogen</em>,
while the fats and carbohydrates are composed principally
of <em>carbon</em>, <em>oxygen</em>, and <em>hydrogen</em>, but no nitrogen.
The so-called extractives or flavoring properties
of meats are nitrogenous, and are consequently
classed with the protein compounds.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The body of an average person contains about
<em>eighteen</em> per cent. of protein. The proteins of various
kinds furnish nutriment for blood and muscle,
hence the term "muscle-formers," which is sometimes
given them. They also furnish material for tendons
and other nitrogenous tissues. When these are worn
out by use, it is protein which repairs the waste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the valuable work upon the analysis of food
has been done in Germany. From estimates made by
chemists of that country it has been decided that the
amount of protein in a diet should not fall below <em>four
ounces daily</em>. This is to represent an allowance for a
man of average weight doing an average amount of
work, below which he cannot go without loss in health,
in work, or in both. Although protein is the most expensive
of all food materials, one should endeavor to
use at least four ounces each day. Meat, milk, eggs,
cheese, fish of all kinds, but especially dried cod,
wheat, beans, and oatmeal are all rich in this substance.
The protein compounds are divided into three
classes:</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90">ALBUMINOIDS, GELATINOIDS, EXTRACTIVES.</p>

<p><b>Albuminoids.</b> The most perfect type of an albuminoid
is the white of egg. It is a viscous, glairy, thick
fluid which occurs also in the flesh of meat as one of
its juices, in fish, in milk, in wheat as gluten, and in
other foods. It is soluble in cold water.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp.</b> Mix some white of egg in a tumbler with half a cup
of cold water. As soon as the viscousness is broken up it
will be found to be completely dissolved. It is insoluble in
alcohol.</p>

<p><b>Exp.</b> Pour upon some white of egg double its bulk of alcohol.
It will coagulate into a somewhat hard opaque mass.</p></div>

<p>Heat also has the power of coagulating albumen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Coagulation of Albumen by Heat.</b> Put into a test-tube
some white of egg, and place the tube in a dish of warm water.
Heat the water gradually over a gas-flame or an alcohol-lamp.
When the temperature reaches 134° Fahr. it will be seen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
little white threads have begun to appear; continue the heating
to 160°, when the whole mass becomes white and firm. Now remove
a part from the tube and test its consistency; it will be
found to be tender, soft, and jelly-like. Replace the tube in
the dish of water and raise the heat to 200° Fahr.; then take
out a little more and test again; it will now be found hard,
close-grained, and somewhat tough. Continue the heating, when
it will be seen that the tenacity increases with rise of temperature
until at 212° Fahr., the boiling-point of water, it is a firm,
compact solid. When heated to about 350°, white of egg becomes
so tenacious that it is used as a valuable cement for
marble.</p></div>

<p>These experiments illustrate a very important point
in the cooking of albuminous foods. They show that
the proper temperature for albumen is that at which
it is thoroughly coagulated, but not hardened; that
is, about 160° Fahr. Most kinds of meat, milk, eggs,
oysters, and fish, when cooked with reference to their
albumen alone, we find are also done in the best possible
manner with reference to their other constituents.
For instance, if you cook an oyster thinking only of
its albuminous juice, and endeavor to raise the temperature
throughout all of its substance to, or near,
160° Fahr., and not higher, you will find it most satisfactory
as to flavor, consistency, and digestibility.
The same is true of eggs done in all ways, and of
dishes made with eggs, such as custards, creams, and
puddings. With the knowledge that albumen coagulates
at a temperature of 52° below that of boiling
water, one can appreciate the necessity of cooking
eggs in water that is not boiling, and a little experiment
like the above will impress it upon the mind as
no amount of mere explanation can possibly do.</p>

<p>The cooking of eggs, whether poached, cooked in
the shell, or in omelets, is of much importance, for
albumen when hard, compact, and tenacious is very
difficult of digestion; the gastric juice cannot easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
penetrate it; sometimes it is not digested at all; while
that which is properly done&mdash;cooked in such a way
that it is tender and falls apart easily&mdash;is one of the
most valuable forms of food for the sick.</p>

<p>Albumen should always be prepared in such manner
as to require the least possible expenditure of
force in digestion. Those who are ill cannot afford
to waste energy. Whether they are forced to do so
in the digestion of their food depends very much
upon the person who prepares it.</p>

<p>Advantage is often taken, in cooking, of the fact
that albumen hardens on exposure to certain degrees
of heat, to form protecting layers over pieces of broiling
steak, roast meats, etc. If a piece of meat is
placed in cold water to cook, it is evident, since albumen
is soluble in cold water, that some of it will be
wasted. If the same piece is plunged into boiling
water the albumen in its outer layers will be immediately
hardened, and form a sheath over the whole
which will keep in the juices and the very important
flavors. When broth or soup is made, we put the
meat (cut into small pieces to expose a large extent
of surface) into cold water, because we wish to draw
out as much as possible the soluble matter and the
flavors. If, on the other hand, the meat is to be served
boiled, and broth or soup is not the object, then this
order should be reversed, and every effort made to prevent
the escape of any of the ingredients of the meat
into the liquid.</p>

<p>In broiling steak, we sacrifice a thin layer of the
outside to form a protecting covering over the whole
by plunging it into the hottest part of the fire, so that
the albumen will become suddenly hard and firm, and
plug up the pores, thus preventing the savory juices
from oozing out. More will be said on this subject
in the recipes for cooking these kinds of foods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Gelatinoids.</b> The second class of protein compounds
comprises the gelatinoids, gelatin being their leading
constituent. It is found in flesh, tendons, cartilage
and bone; in fact, it exists in all the tissues of
the body, for the walls of most of the microscopic cells
of which the tissues are composed contain gelatin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp.</b> Boil a pound of lean meat freed from tendons, fat,
and bone, in a pint of water for three hours; then set the
liquid away to cool. Jelly resembling calf's-foot jelly will be
the result. The cell-walls of the flesh have been dissolved by
the long-continued action of heat and liquid. This is commonly
called stock or glaze.</p>

<p><b>Exp.</b> Put a piece of clean bone into a dilute solution of hydrochloric
acid. In two or three days the acid will have acted
upon the earthy matters in the bone to remove them, and gelatin
will remain. The average amount in bone is about thirty
per cent.</p></div>

<p>Calves' feet were formerly used for jelly because of
the excess of gelatin which they contain. They were
cooked in water for a long time and the liquid
reduced by further boiling; it was then clarified,
flavored, and cooled; the result was a transparent,
trembling jelly. The prepared gelatin of commerce,
or <em>gelatine</em>, has now largely displaced this, for it is
much more convenient to use, and less expensive.</p>

<p><b>Extractives.</b> The extractives or flavoring properties
of meats and other substances are usually classed
with the protein compounds. Their chemical nature
is not well understood.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h4>FATS</h4>

<p><b>Fixed and Volatile Oils.</b> There are two classes of
fats, called <em>fixed oils</em> and <em>volatile oils</em>. All kinds of
fats good for food belong to the class of fixed oils.
A volatile oil is one which evaporates away, like alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
or water, and leaves no residue. The fixed oils,
at least most of them, will not do this; they do not
vaporize even at very high temperatures, but they become
dissociated or decomposed,&mdash;that is, their chemical
structure is broken up before their boiling-point
is reached. Volatile oils, on the contrary, are capable
of being boiled and transformed into gases. Some
one illustrates this by the changes which take place
in water. When water is heated to 212° Fahr. it is
converted into a gas, which on cooling below 212°
returns to the liquid state again without loss. The
essential oil, turpentine, if heated to 320° Fahr. ceases
to be a liquid and becomes a gas, which on cooling
becomes a liquid oil again without loss of weight.
Other volatile oils are oil of cloves, oil of bitter
almonds, orange and lemon oil, oil of cinnamon,
bergamot, and patchouli.</p>

<p>The boiling sometimes noticed in a pot of lard is
owing to the presence in it of a little water which is
very soon converted into steam, when the bubbling
ceases, and after that the temperature of the fat
rises rapidly, reaching in a short time four or five
hundred degrees Fahrenheit, when a separation of
its constituents takes place, and carbon is revealed as
a black mass.</p>

<p><b>Composition of Fats.</b> Fats are <em>hydrocarbons</em>&mdash;that
is, they are composed chiefly of carbon united with
hydrogen and oxygen. They must not be confounded
with the <em>carbohydrates</em>, which are always composed
of carbon with the elements of water&mdash;that is,
the proportion of hydrogen to oxygen is as two to
one,&mdash;whereas in the hydrocarbons this is not the case.
These elements enter into the compositions of fats as
various fatty acids and glycerin; the acids are not
sour, as one would suppose from the name, but are so
called because they behave chemically toward bases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as sour acids do, that is, they unite with them. The
glycerin of commerce is obtained by decomposing
fats.</p>

<p><b>Fat in Milk.</b> The white color of milk is given to
it by minute globules of fat suspended in it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>To prove this</b>: Put a little milk into a bottle with a
ground-glass stopper; pour upon it three times its bulk of
ether and shake gently; let it stand for two or three days,
when it will be found that the ether has dissolved the fat
and left a semi-transparent yellowish white liquid resembling
blood serum. By pipetting or carefully pouring off the
ether, and evaporating it by placing the vessel containing it
in a dish of warm water, clear oil will be obtained. Care
must be taken not to put the ether near a flame or the fire,
as it is highly inflammable, and an explosion might occur.
Ether boils at 94.82° Fahr.</p></div>

<p>The proportion of fat in milk is from 2.8 to 8 per
cent. It varies in milk from different species of
cows, and from the same species at different times,
according to age, feeding, and other circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Cream.</b> When milk is allowed to stand without
disturbance for a time the globules of fat, being lighter
than water, rise to the surface and form cream. Cream
is the most wholesome, palatable, and easily digested
form of fat. Butter is obtained by beating milk or
cream in a churn until the little globules of fat break
and stick together in a mass.</p>

<p><b>Olive-Oil.</b> Olive-oil is one of the most easily digested
and palatable of fats. A genuine oil of the
first quality is, in this country unfortunately, expensive,
much of that sold under the name being adulterated
with cotton-seed oil, poppy-oil, and essence
of lard.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>Cotton-seed oil has no especially bad flavor, but it
is unpleasant and indigestible when used raw as in
sardines and salads. The after taste which it leaves
reminds one too forcibly of castor-oil.</p>

<p>Olive-oil of the best quality is almost absolutely
without flavor. It is prepared in several grades: the
first pressing from the fruit is the best, the second is
fair, the third inferior, and there is sometimes a fourth
known as refuse oil. For deep fat frying nothing is
so good as olive-oil, but its costliness in this country
excludes it from common use.</p>

<p>The fat of the sheep and ox, after it has been rendered,
and deprived of all membrane and fibers, is
called <em>tallow</em>. The term is also applied to the fat of
other animals, and to that of some plants, as bayberry-tallow,
piny tallow, and others. The uncooked fat of
any animal is called <em>suet</em>, but the name has come to
be applied to the less easily melted kinds, which surround
the kidneys or are in other parts of the loin.
The fat which falls in drops from meat in roasting is
called <em>dripping</em>.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h4>THE CARBOHYDRATES</h4>

<p><b>Starch.</b> Starch is a substance found in wheat, corn,
oats, and in fact in all grains, in potatoes, in the
roots and stems of many plants, and in some fruits.
In a pure state it is a white powder such as is seen in
arrowroot and corn-starch. Examined by a microscope
this powder is found to be made up of tiny grains
of different shapes and sizes, some rounded or oval,
others irregular. Those of potato-starch are ovoid,
with an outside covering which appears to be folded
or ridged, and looks somewhat like the outside of an
oyster-shell, although its similarity extends no further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
than appearance, as the little ridges are true folds, and
not overlapping edges.</p>

<p><b>Size of Starch Grains.</b> Starch grains vary in size according
to the source from which the starch is obtained.
Those of ground rice are very small, being
about
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over">3000</span>
</span>
of an inch in diameter; those of wheat are
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over">1000</span>
</span>
of an inch, and those of potato
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over">300</span>
</span>
of an inch.</p>

<p>Starch is a carbohydrate, being composed of six
parts of carbon, ten of hydrogen, and five of oxygen.
Its symbol is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. It is insoluble in water, but
when the water is heated, the grains seem to absorb it;
they increase in size, the ridges or folds disappear,
and when the temperature reaches 140° Fahr. or a
little over, they burst, and the contents mingle with
the liquid forming the well-known paste.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Test for Starch.</b> Mix a teaspoon of starch with a cup of
cold water and boil them together for a few minutes until a
paste is formed; then set it aside to cool. Meanwhile make a
solution of iodine by putting a few flakes into alcohol, or use
that which is already prepared, and which may be obtained at
any pharmacy. Add a drop of this solution to the paste mixture;
it will immediately color the whole a rich dark blue.
This is known as the "iodine test," and is a very valuable one
to the chemist, for by means of it the slightest trace of starch
can be detected.</p>

<p><b>Exp. with Arrowroot.</b> Make a thin paste by boiling a little
arrowroot and water together. When cool test it with a drop
of the iodine solution. The characteristic blue color will be
very strong, showing that arrowroot is rich in starch.</p></div>

<p>Similar tests may be made with grated potato,
wheat-flour, rice-flour, tapioca, and other starch-containing
substances. Also powdered sugar, cream of
tartar, and other substances may be tested, when it
is suspected that they have been adulterated with
starch.</p>

<p>Although starch grains burst and form a paste
with water at 140° Fahr., that is not the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
at which it should be cooked for food, and the thickening
which then takes place should not be confounded,
as often happens, with the true cooking of
starch. In order to understand the difference between
the proper cooking of starch and the simple
bursting of the grains, let us consider the changes
which take place in starch when it is subjected to
different degrees of heat, and also those which are
produced in it during the process of digestion. All
starch in food is changed into dextrine and then into
sugar (glucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in the process of digestion.
Glucose is a kind of sugar, resembling cane-sugar,
but it is not so sweet.</p>

<p><b>Dextrine.</b> Dextrine is a substance having the same
chemical nature as starch, but differing in many of
its properties. It may be described as a condition
which starch assumes just before its change into
glucose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp. to show Dextrine.</b> Carefully dry and then heat a little
starch to about 400° Fahr. Keep it at this temperature until it
turns brown, or for ten minutes. Then mix it with water, when
it will dissolve, forming a gummy solution. Starch will not do
this. Test it with iodine; it will not change color. The remarkable
thing about the relation of dextrine to starch is that
although they differ so much in properties they have the same
chemical composition.</p></div>

<p>The change of starch into dextrine is an important
point in cooking, because starch cannot be assimilated
until the conversion has taken place, either before or
after it is eaten. Now it will be seen that unless this
change is either produced or approached in the cooking
of starch-containing foods, they are not prepared
as well as it is possible to prepare them; also, that it
is not possible to cause this change at a low temperature;
therefore 140° (the temperature at which the
grains burst) should not be regarded as the cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
temperature of starch. It should be such a temperature
as shall actually convert it into dextrine, or at
least change it to such an extent that it will be more
easily converted into dextrine, and ultimately into
sugar, by the digestive fluids. This should be as
near 401° Fahr. as practicable,&mdash;not that a potato,
or a loaf of bread, or a pudding will have all the
starch in it changed when it is put into an oven of
that temperature. It would not be possible, on account
of the water contained in each; but that in the
outside may be, and the preparation of the remainder
will be better than at a lower temperature.</p>

<p>There are other means of changing starch into dextrine
than by heat, one of the most remarkable of
which is <em>diastase</em>, a substance found in sprouting
grains, which has the power to transform the starch
stored in the grain by nature into soluble dextrine, in
which form it can be taken up by the young plant for
food. The crude starch could not thus be absorbed.
The starch which we use as food is of no more value
to us than it is to the young plant until it has been
changed into dextrine or sugar. Now, if art outside
of the body can accomplish what nature is otherwise
forced to do in the alimentary canal, the body will be
saved a certain amount of force,&mdash;a point of great importance,
especially in the case of the sick or invalid,
who can ill afford to waste energy.</p>

<p>Starch constitutes half of bread, our "staff of life";
nearly all of rice, the staff of life in the East; and the
greater part of corn-starch, sago, arrowroot, tapioca,
peas, beans, turnips, carrots, and potatoes.</p>

<p><em>Arrowroot</em> is the purest form of starch food known.
<em>Rice</em> is richest in starch of all the grains. <em>Tapioca</em> is
prepared from the root of a tropical plant; it is first
crushed and the grains washed out with water, then
the whole is heated and stirred, thus cooking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
breaking the starch grains, which on cooling assume
the irregular rough shapes seen in the ordinary tapioca
of commerce. Probably a part of the starch is converted
into dextrine, which accounts for the peculiarly
agreeable flavor which tapioca possesses. Mixed with
the grains, as they are taken from the plant, is a very
dangerous poison which, being soluble in water and
volatile, is partially washed away and partially driven
out by the heat,&mdash;in fact the heating is done for this
purpose. <em>Sago</em> is principally starch. It is obtained
from the pith of the sago-palm. Imitations of both
tapioca and sago are sometimes made from common
starch.</p>

<p>Starch may be converted into grape-sugar by treating
it with acids; that of corn is generally used for the
purpose. Much of the glucose of commerce is made
in this way. In the United States it is estimated that
$10,000,000 worth is manufactured every year. It is
used for table syrup, in brewing beer, in the adulteration
of cane-sugar, and in confectionery. Honey is
also made from it. The nutritive value of vegetables
is due largely to the starch and sugar which they
contain.</p>

<p>In the economy of the body starch is eminently a
heat producer. Pound for pound it does not give as
much heat as fat, but owing to its great abundance
and extensive use it, in the aggregate, produces
more. (Atwater.)</p>

<p>Starch is an abundant and easily digested form of
vegetable food, but it is incapable of sustaining life.
It contains none of the nitrogenous matter needed for
the nutrition of the muscles, nerves, and tissues. Indeed,
it is said on good authority that many an invalid
has been slowly starved to death from being fed
upon this material alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Sugar.</b> There are many kinds of sugar, the most
familiar of which is <em>cane-sugar</em>, or <em>sucrose</em> (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>).
It is obtained from the juices of various plants, for
instance, sugar-cane, beet-root, the sugar-maple, and
certain kinds of palms. By far the greatest amount
comes from the sugar-cane. It is made by crushing
the stalks of the plant (which somewhat resembles
Indian corn) and extracting the sweet juice, which is
then clarified and evaporated until, on cooling, crystals
appear in a thick liquid; this liquid is molasses,
and the grains or crystals are brown sugar. White
sugar is obtained by melting this brown sugar in
water, removing the impurities, and again evaporating
in vacuum-pans, which are used for the purpose
of boiling the liquid at a lower temperature than
it could be boiled in the open air, thus avoiding the
danger of burning, and otherwise preserving certain
qualities of the sugar. <em>Loaf-sugar</em> is made by separating
the crystals from the liquid by draining in
molds; and <em>granulated</em> sugar by forcing out the
syrup in a centrifugal machine. The process of making
beet-root sugar is similar. Sugar from maple sap
is obtained by simply evaporating away the excess of
water. In the East a considerable quantity of sugar
is made from the juices of certain varieties of palm,
especially the date-palm. Maple-sugar and palm-sugar
are generally not purified.</p>

<p>Sucrose dissolves readily in water. By allowing
such a solution to stand undisturbed for a time until
the water has disappeared, transparent crystals are
obtained, known as <em>rock candy</em>. Again, sucrose melted
at a temperature of 320° Fahr. forms, on cooling, a
clear mass, called <em>barley-sugar</em>. Heated to 420° Fahr.
dissociation of the carbon from the water of crystallization
takes place, the carbon appearing in its characteristic
black color. This dark brown, sweetish-bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
syrup is called <em>caramel</em>. On cooling it forms a solid,
which may be dissolved in water, and is used to color
gravies, soups, beer, and so forth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Exp. with Sulphuric Acid.</b> A very pretty experiment to
show the separation of the water from the carbon may be made
by treating a little sugar in sulphuric acid. Put a tablespoon
of sugar in any vessel that will bear heat, a thin glass or stout
cup. Pour over enough concentrated sulphuric acid to thoroughly
moisten it, let it stand for a few minutes, when it will be
seen that the mass has changed color from white to a yellowish
brown. The color increases in intensity until it is perfectly
black, when the whole puffs and swells up, fumes are driven
off, and a mass like a cinder remains. This is charcoal, or
nearly pure carbon.</p></div>

<p>The explanation is as follows: So strong is the
affinity of the acid for the water that it breaks up the
chemical combination between it and the carbon,
unites with the water, and leaves the carbon free. So
intense is the chemical change that an enormous
amount of heat is evolved,&mdash;so much, in fact, that a
considerable part of the water is vaporized, leaving
the more or less solid charcoal. The light color noticed
during the first part of the union indicates that
the chemical dissociation is just beginning, and that
only a small amount of carbon has been set free.</p>

<p><b>Glucose.</b> Glucose or grape-sugar (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) is one
of the kinds of sugar found in grapes, peaches, and
other fruits. It is about two and one half times less
sweet than cane-sugar. It is manufactured on a large
scale from the starch of corn.</p>

<p><b>Lactose.</b> Lactose or milk-sugar is the sugar found
in the milk of the <em>Mammalia</em>. That of commerce
comes chiefly from Switzerland, where it is made by
evaporating the whey of cow's milk. For sweetening
drinks for infants and for the sick, milk-sugar is said
to be less liable to produce acid fermentation than
cane-sugar, and also to be more easily digested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Sugar is a valuable nutrient, being very easily digested
and absorbed. Cane-sugar is converted into
glucose in the process of digestion by the pancreatic
juice, and after absorption it is completely utilized in
the body, furnishing heat and probably energy.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Heat on Sugar.</b> Sugar undergoes various
changes, with different degrees of heat, by loss of
some of its water of crystallization. One of the most
remarkable of these is seen in caramel sauce, which is
a rich crimson-brown syrup generally supposed to
contain foreign coloring matter, but which does not.
It is made by melting sugar without water, and heating
it until the desired hue and thickness are reached.
Nothing is added, but something is taken away; that
is, some of the water is driven out, with the result of
change in both color and taste.</p>

<p>In a recent article in "The Century Magazine" (November,
1891) Prof. Atwater touches upon the subject
of the production of artificial foods from the
crude materials of the earth, and states, among other
things, that a sugar resembling fruit-sugar has been
made artificially by synthesis, by Prof. Fischer of
Würzburg, Germany.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h4>AIR</h4>

<p>Air is a gaseous elastic body which envelops the
earth on every side, extending possibly two hundred
miles from its surface, but all the while growing more
and more rare as the distance increases. When pure it
is tasteless and odorless. We really live at the bottom
of an atmospheric ocean, and are pressed upon by its
weight. At the sea-level the pressure upon every
square inch of surface is equal to fifteen pound.</p>

<p><b>Atmospheric Pressure Variable.</b> Atmospheric pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
diminishes and is constantly variable, according
to the height above the sea-level. If we ascend into
the air 5000 feet, it is perfectly evident that there are
5000 feet less of atmosphere pressing upon us than at
the point from which we started. This diminution
of pressure is often measured by the temperature at
which water boils at different heights.</p>

<p><b>Composition.</b> An average composition of the atmosphere
has been previously stated. Besides nitrogen
and oxygen, it always contains water in the form
of vapor, and carbonic acid. The amount of aqueous
vapor in the air changes according to the temperature;
the amount of carbonic acid is also constantly
variable. Air usually contains, in addition to these,
traces of ammonia, organic matter which includes
micro-organisms, ozone, salts of sodium, and other
mineral matters in minute and variable quantities.</p>

<p><b>Air in Motion.</b> The atmosphere is almost always in
motion. We feel it in the gentle breeze and the more
forcible wind. If it moves at a slower rate than two
and one half feet a second this motion is not noticeable.
Motion in the air is caused by the unequal heating
of portions of it. If from any cause the atmosphere
over a certain region becomes warm, it will expand
(all bodies expand with heat), become lighter, and its
tendency will be to move in the direction of least resistance,&mdash;that
is, upward; so we say heated air rises.
Currents of cooler air will immediately flow in to
take its place, and thus we have a breeze, a wind, or
a gale, according to the velocity and force with which
the currents move. It is upon a knowledge of these
movements that the theory of ventilation is based.
It is because of the constant motion of air-currents
that out of doors, except in densely populated cities,
air remains constantly pure. When poisonous gases
and other impurities accumulate, winds scatter them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
far and wide until they are so diluted as to be harmless;
or under some conditions they unite with other
things and form new and simple substances of a
harmless nature, while under others, if they are compounds,
they may be decomposed or washed down to
the surface of the earth again.</p>

<p><b>Impurities.</b> The chief chemical product of fires and
of that slower combustion breathing is carbonic acid.
Plants during the day, and under the influence of
sunlight, take it up from the air for food, use the carbon
for their growth, freeing the oxygen which man
and the lower animals need. Thus is the balance
most beautifully maintained.</p>

<p>Air is purest over the sea and over wind-swept
heights of land. It, however, always contains some
foreign substances, and always micro-organisms except
over mid-ocean. Even the upper strata of
atmosphere are not free from microscopic forms of
life, as has been shown in experiments made with hail
at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1890 by Dr. Abbott.
Large hailstones were washed in distilled and sterilized
water, and then melted, and cultures made from
different layers; in all of these organisms were found,
showing that they extend into the air a long distance
from the earth.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Impurities of various kinds are constantly passing
into the air, but so vast is the expanse of the atmosphere
as compared with the impurities daily thrown
into it from the lungs of man and the lower animals,
from fires, manufactories, and decomposing matter,
that they quickly disappear.</p>

<p>Air is the greatest or, as one writer says, the most
immediate necessity of life. We could live without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it only a few seconds. We constantly use it, whether
sleeping or waking, and perhaps this accounts in part
for the utter carelessness and indifference which most
people have for the quality of that which they breathe.
Even those persons who know something of the
nature of air, make but little effort to provide
themselves with a constantly pure supply.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Breathing Bad Air.</b> If the effects of
breathing bad air were immediate, there would then
be an immediate remedy for the present total lack of
any systematic means of ventilation in most houses.
But the effects of breathing bad air are, like those of
some slow and insidious poison, not noticeable at
once, and often manifested under the name of some
disease which gives no clue to the true cause.</p>

<p>Dr. Van Rensselaer, in the Orton Prize Essay on
Impure Air and Ventilation, makes the statement
that statistics show that of the causes of mortality the
most important and farthest-reaching is impure air.</p>

<p><b>Amount of Air Required for one Person.</b> Sanitarians
have agreed that each individual requires at least
3000 cubic feet of air every hour. A room 10 × 15 × 20
holds 3000 cubic feet of air, which should be changed
once every hour in order that one individual shall
have the required amount. If three persons are in
the room, it must be changed three times.</p>

<p>The effect of bad ventilation is well illustrated by
the condition of the horses in the French army some
years ago. With small close stables the mortality
was 197 in every 1000 annually. The simple enlargement
of the stables, and consequent increase of
breathing-space, reduced the number in the course of
time to 68 in every 1000, and later, from 1862 to 1866,
with some attention paid to the air-supply, the number
fell to 28½ per 1000.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Necessity for a Constant Supply of Pure Air.</b> When
we consider that the food we eat and digest cannot
nourish the body until it has been acted upon by
oxygen in the lungs, and that this action must be
constant, never ceasing, it will help us to understand
the necessity for a constant supply of air such as
shall furnish us a due proportion of the life-giving
principle, oxygen, and which shall not contain
impurities that interfere with its absorption.</p>

<p>We take into the lungs a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen,
and carbonic acid. We give out a mixture
which has lost some of its oxygen, and gained in
carbonic acid. Now, unless the amount of oxygen
is what it should be, the blood will not gain from
an inspiration the amount it should receive, consequently
it will be but imperfectly purified and able
but imperfectly to nourish the body. So the whole
system suffers, and if a person for a long time continues
to breathe such an atmosphere, the condition
of the body will become so reduced as to produce disease.
Even though in other ways one lives wisely, all
the factors of health multiplied together cannot withstand
the one of impure air. We eat food three or
four times daily. Some of us are very particular
about its quality. We breathe air every instant of
our lives, but generally we give but little consideration
as to whether it is pure or impure.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation.</b> No attempt will be made here to explain
different devices for ventilation, but only to
touch upon the principle it involves. Its objects are
(1) to remove air which has been breathed once; (2) to
remove the products of combustion, whether from fires,
lamps, gas, or other sources; (3) to carry away all other
substances which may be generated from any cause,
in a room or building, as the impurities from manufacturing,
those arising from decaying matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and micro-organisms. In a climate where artificial
warmth is necessary a part of the year, it is difficult
to warm and ventilate a room at the same time, without
causing unpleasant drafts; but with some knowledge
of the necessity of ventilation, and of the properties
of air, one may in some measure work out
a scheme of ventilation adapted to the circumstances
in which he finds himself.</p>

<p>There are always the doors and windows, which
may be thrown wide open at intervals, and in many
houses there are fireplaces. If a window be opened
at the bottom at one side of a room, and another be
opened at the top on an opposite side, a current of
air will be established from the first window, passing
through the room and out at the second. This plan
will do very well in warm weather when the temperature
outside is about the same as that of the room,
but it would be impracticable in cold weather. Then
we may resort to the very simple plan of placing a
board about eight or ten inches wide across the window
at the bottom and inside of the sash. Then
when the lower half of the window is raised, a space
is left between the upper and lower sashes, through
which the air passes freely as it enters, and, being
sent into the room in an upward direction, causes no
draft. The board is for the purpose of closing the
window below, and should fit quite close to the sash.</p>

<p>Fireplaces are good, though not perfect, ventilators.
Then there are the preventive measures, such as
burning the gas or lamp low at night, avoiding oil- and
gas-stoves, etc.; the latter are the worst possible means
of heating rooms, for not only do they draw oxygen
for burning from the air, but they give out the polluting
carbonic acid and other products of combustion,
which in a coal- or wood-stove go up the chimney.</p>

<p>A well-ventilated room should have an inflow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
warm, pure air, and a means for the removal of the
same after it has been used, the current being so controlled
that, although the air is kept in motion, there
is no perceptible draft.</p>

<p>The plan for the heating and ventilation of the
Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, is a
most admirable one. Air from out of doors is conveyed
by a flue into a chamber in the wall, in which are
coils of pipe filled with hot water. The air in passing
over these becomes warm, and, rising, passes into the
room to be heated through a register. On the opposite
side of the room is a chimney-like flue, running
to the top of the building and containing
two registers, by the opening and closing of which
the movements of the air in the room can be controlled.
The temperature is maintained by the temperature
of the water in the pipes, and the rapidity
of the flow.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The ventilation by this method of heating is the
most perfect known to the author, who has lived for
two years in a building thus supplied with warmth
and fresh air. The rooms were invariably comfortable
as to temperature, and the air as invariably sweet and
pure.</p>

<h3><a name="MILK" id="MILK"></a>MILK</h3>

<p>Milk is one of our most perfect types of food, containing
water and solids in such proportions as are
known to be needful for the nourishment of the body.
A proof of this is seen in the fact that it is the only
food of the young of the <em>Mammalia</em> during the time
of their greatest growth. It contains those food principles
in such amounts as to contribute to the rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
formation of bone and the various tissues of the body,
which takes place in infancy and childhood; but after
this growth is attained, and the individual requires
that which will repair the tissues and furnish warmth
and energy, milk ceases to be a complete food.</p>

<p><b>Composition of Cow's Milk.</b> The composition of
cow's milk varies with the breed and age, care and
feeding, of the animals. Cows which are kept in foul
air in stables all the year, and fed upon bad food
such as the refuse from breweries and kitchens, give
a quality of milk which is perhaps more to be dreaded
than that from any other source; for such animals are
especially liable to disease, and are often infected with
tuberculosis, pneumonia, and other fatal maladies.
Cows are particularly susceptible to tuberculosis, and
may convey it to human beings either in their milk
or flesh. According to Dr. Miller, cow's milk contains
the following ingredients:</p>


<div class="center fs80">

<tr><td class="tdl">Nitrogenous matter and insoluble salts</td><td class="tdrx">3.6%</td></tr>

<p>Another analysis is that of Uffelmann:</p>

</table></div>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Milk from healthy, well-nourished
cows should be of full white color, opaque, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a slightly yellowish tinge sometimes described as
"cream white." It should vary but slightly in composition
from the above analyses. The fat should
not be less than 2.5%. The amount of fat may be
easily determined with a Feser's lactoscope (Eimer
and Amend, New York), directions for the use of
which come with the instruments. It will generally
vary from 3% to 4% in good milk. Should it fall
below 2.5% the milk should be rejected as too poor for
use. Such milk has probably been skimmed, or comes
from unhealthy or poorly fed cows.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of milk should be from 1.027 to
1.033. This may be found with a Quevenne's lactometer.
If it falls below 1.027, one has a right to claim
that the milk has been watered or that the cows are
in poor condition.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The reaction of good milk varies from slightly alkaline
to slightly acid or neutral. That from the same
cow will be different on different days, even under the
same apparent conditions of care, varying from one to
the other, probably because of some difference in the
nature of the food she has eaten. However, if the
reaction is <em>decidedly</em> alkaline, and red litmus-paper
becomes a distinct blue, the milk is not good, and
possibly the animal is diseased. Should the reaction
be decidedly acid, it shows that the milk has been
contaminated, either from the air by long exposure,
or from the vessels which held it, with those micro-organisms
which by their growth produce an acid, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
certain amount of which causes what is known as
"souring."</p>

<p>Milk from perfectly healthy and perfectly kept
cows is <em>neutral</em>, leaving both red and blue litmus-paper
unchanged; but as a general thing milk is
slightly acid, even when transported directly from
the producer to the consumer and handled by fairly
clean workmen in fairly clean vessels. Such milk
two or three hours old when examined microscopically
is found to contain millions of organisms. Milk
is one of the best of foods for bacteria, many of the
ordinary forms growing in it with exceeding rapidity
under favorable conditions of temperature. Now it
has been found that such milk, although it may not
contain the seeds of any certain disease, sometimes
causes in young children, and the sick, very serious
digestive disturbances, and may thus become indirectly
the cause of fatal maladies.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>All milk, unless it is <em>positively known</em> to be given
by healthy, well-nourished animals, and kept in thoroughly
cleaned vessels free from contamination, should
be sterilized before using. Often the organisms found
in milk are of disease-giving nature. In Europe and
America many cases of typhoid fever, scarlatina, and
diphtheria have been traced to the milk-supply. In
fact milk and water are two of the most fruitful food
sources of disease. It therefore immediately becomes
apparent that, unless these two liquids are above suspicion,
they should be sterilized before using. Boiling
water for half an hour will render it sterile, but milk
would be injured by evaporation and other changes
produced in its constituents by such long exposure to
so high a degree of heat. A better method, and one
which should be adopted by all who understand something
of the nature of bacteria, is to expose the milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for a longer time to a lower temperature than that of
boiling.</p>

<p><b>To Sterilize Milk for Immediate Use.</b> (1) Pour the
milk into a granite-ware saucepan or a double boiler,
raise the temperature to 190° Fahr., and keep it at
that point for one hour. (2) As soon as done put it
immediately into a pitcher, or other vessel, which has
been thoroughly washed, and boiled in a bath of water,
and cool quickly by placing in a pan of cold or iced
water. A chemist's thermometer, for testing the temperature,
may be bought at any pharmacy for a small
sum, but if there is not one at hand, heat the milk
until a scum forms over the top, and then keep it as
nearly as possible at that temperature for one hour.
Do not let it boil.</p>

<p><b>To Sterilize Milk which is not for Immediate Use.</b> Put
the milk into flasks or bottles with narrow mouths;
plug them with a long stopper of cotton-wool, place
the flasks in a wire frame to support them, in a kettle
of cold water, heat gradually to 190° Fahr., and keep
it at that temperature for one hour. Repeat this the
second day, for although all organisms were probably
destroyed during the first process, <em>spores</em> which
may have escaped will have developed into bacteria.
These will be killed by the second heating. Repeat
again on the third day to destroy any life that may
have escaped the first two.</p>

<p>Spores or resting-cells are the germinal cells from
which new bacteria develop, and are capable of surviving
a much higher temperature than the bacteria
themselves, as well as desiccation and severe cold.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Some writers give a lower temperature than 190° Fahr.
as safe for sterilization with one hour's exposure, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
190 may be relied upon. Milk treated by the last or
"fractional" method of sterilization, as it is called,
should keep indefinitely, provided of course the cotton
is not disturbed. Cotton-wool or cotton batting
in thick masses acts as a strainer for bacteria, and
although air will enter, organisms will not.</p>

<p>All persons who buy milk, or in any way control
milk-supplies, should consider themselves in duty
bound to (1) ascertain by personal investigation the
condition in which the cows are kept. If there is any
suspicion that they are diseased, a veterinary surgeon
should be consulted to decide the case. If they are
healthy and well fed, they cannot fail to give good
milk, and nothing more is to be done except to see
that it is transported in perfectly cleansed and scalded
vessels. (2) If it is impossible to obtain milk directly
from the producer, and one is obliged to buy that
from unknown sources, it should be sterilized the moment
it enters the house. There is no other means of
being sure that it will not be a bearer of disease. Not
all such milk contains disease-producing organisms,
but it all may contain them, and there is no safety in
its use until all bacteria have been deprived of life.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h3>DIGESTION</h3>

<p><b>Definition.</b> Digestion is the breaking up, changing,
and liquefying of the food in the various chambers of
the alimentary canal designed for that purpose. The
mechanical breaking up is done principally by the
teeth in the mouth, the chemical changes and liquefying
by the various digestive fluids.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Digestive Fluids.</b> The digestive fluids are true secretions.
Each is formed from the blood by a special
gland for the purpose which never does anything else;
they do not exist in the blood as such. Their flow is
intermittent, taking place only when they are needed.
The liver, however, is an exception to all the others. It
is both secretory and excretory, and bile is formed all
the time, but is most abundant during digestion.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><b>Saliva.</b> The fluid which is mixed with the food in
the mouth is secreted by a considerable number and
variety of glands, the principal of which are the parotid,
submaxillary, and sublingual. Smaller glands
in the roof and sides of the mouth, in the tongue, and
in the mucous membrane of the pharynx contribute
to the production of saliva, the digestive fluid of the
mouth. The flow from the parotid gland is greatest.
The flow from all the glands is greatly increased
when food is taken, especially if it be of good flavor.
Sometimes the amount is increased by smell alone, as
when a nice steak is cooking, or a savory soup, and
sometimes the saliva is made copious by thought, as
when we remember the taste of dishes eaten in the
past, and we say, "It makes the mouth water just to
think of them."</p>

<p><b>Amount of Saliva.</b> According to Dalton the amount
of saliva secreted every twenty-four hours is 42½ oz.
Its reaction is almost constantly alkaline. It is composed
of water, organic matter, and various mineral
salts. Ptyalin is its active principle, and is called by
some authors <em>animal diastase</em>, or starch converter.</p>

<p><b>Gastric Juice.</b> Gastric juice is the digestive fluid of
the stomach. It is acid. Its flow is intermittent, occurring
only at times of digestion. Its active principle
is pepsin.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice here that the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
digestive fluids when food is taken is different from
what it is when the organs are at rest. For instance,
the gastric juice which flows in abundance under the
stimulus of food, is not like the fluid secreted when
the stomach is collapsed and empty.</p>

<p><b>Pancreatic Juice.</b> Pancreatic juice is the digestive
juice of the pancreas, and is poured into the small intestine
a short distance below the pyloric opening. Its
reaction is alkaline. Its flow is entirely suspended
during the intervals of digestion.</p>

<p><b>Bile.</b> Bile, the fourth in order of the digestive
liquids, is the secretion of the largest gland of the
body&mdash;the liver. It is poured into the small intestine
by a duct which empties side by side with the duct
from the pancreas. The flow of bile is constant, but
is greatest during digestion.</p>

<p><b>Intestinal Juice.</b> Intestinal juice has been to physiologists
a difficult subject of study. It is mingled
with the salivary and gastric juices at the times of digestion,
when it is most desirable to notice its action.
Nearly all authorities agree that it is alkaline, and
that its function is to complete the digestion of substances
which may reach it in an undigested condition.</p>

<p><b>Mucus of Large Intestine.</b> The mucus secreted by
the large intestine is for lubricating only.</p>

<p><b>Digestion in Different Parts of the Alimentary Tract.</b>
Different substances in food are digested in different
portions of the alimentary canal, and by different
means. Let us begin in the mouth. Taking the
classes of foods, starch, one of the carbohydrates, is
the one most affected by the ptyalin, or animal diastase,
of the saliva. So energetic is the action of
ptyalin on starch that 1 part is sufficient to change
1000 parts. Starch is not acted upon by the gastric
juice of the stomach at all; however, the continued
action of the saliva is not probably interrupted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
stomach. The digestion of starch is completed by
the action of the pancreatic and intestinal juices, and
consists in its being changed into soluble glucose,
which is absorbed in solution.</p>

<p><b>Sugar.</b> Cane-sugar, or common sugar (also called
<em>sucrose</em>), passes through the mouth, unchanged, to the
stomach, where it is converted into glucose by the
slow action of the acid (hydrochloric) of the gastric
juice. Dilute hydrochloric acid has the same action
on sugar outside of the stomach.</p>

<p>The action of pancreatic juice on sugar is very
marked; it immediately changes cane-sugar into glucose.
The effect of intestinal fluid is not well understood,
but there is the general agreement that it does
not change cane-sugar, neither is cane-sugar, as such,
absorbed in the intestine. Bile does not affect it,
therefore cane-sugar is digested or converted into
glucose either by the stomach or pancreas, or both.
It will now be seen that ultimately the same substance,
glucose, is obtained from both starch and
sugar.</p>

<p><b>Protein.</b> We now come to the consideration of the
digestion of the protein compounds, of which albumen
may be taken as a type. Possibly no action except
breaking up and moistening takes place in the
mouth.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Its digestion begins in the stomach, where
its structure is broken up and a separation and dissolution
of the little sacs which hold it take place.
The same thing is partially accomplished outside of
the stomach when white of egg is slightly beaten and
strained through a cloth. Gastric juice further acts
on the albumen itself, forming it into what is called
albumen peptone. The digestion of raw and carefully
cooked albumen has been found to be carried
on very rapidly in the stomach, and the change is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
essentially the same in both cases, but in favor of the
slightly coagulated. When the albumen is rendered
hard, fine, and close in consistency by over-cooking,
then it is less easy of digestion than when raw.</p>

<p><b>Absorption.</b> It is probable that the greater portion
of the process of digestion and absorption of albumen
takes place in the stomach.</p>

<p><b>Fibrin.</b> Fibrin is also digested in the stomach, and
made into fibrin peptone.</p>

<p><b>Casein.</b> Liquid casein is immediately coagulated by
gastric juice, both by the action of free acid and organic
matter.</p>

<p><b>Gelatin.</b> Gelatin is quickly dissolved by gastric
juice, and afterward no longer has the property of
forming jelly on cooling. Gelatin is more rapidly
disposed of than the tissue from which it is produced.</p>

<p><b>Vegetable Protein.</b> The digestion of the vegetable
protein compounds, such as the gluten of wheat and
the protein of the various grains, such as corn, oatmeal,
etc., is undoubtedly carried on in the stomach,
but they must be well softened and prepared by the
action of heat and water, or they will not be digested
anywhere; and often corn, beans, and grains of oatmeal
are rejected entirely unchanged. Partially or
imperfectly digested proteins are affected by intestinal
juice. It is probable that the function of this fluid is
to complete digestive changes in food which have already
begun in the stomach.</p>

<p>To summarize: The digestion and absorption of
nitrogenous compounds take place in both the stomach
and the intestines.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h3>NUTRITION</h3>

<p>One of the important points to bring to the notice
of pupils in the study of cookery is the phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of nutrition. It is astonishing how vague are the
ideas that many people have of why they eat food,
and vaguer still are their notions of the necessity of
air, pure and plenty. Once instruct the mind that
it is the air we breathe and the food we eat which
nourish the body, giving material for its various processes,
for nervous and muscular energy, and for
maintaining the constant temperature which the body
must always possess in order to be in a state of health,
and there is much more likelihood that the dignity
and importance of proper cooking and proper food
will not be overlooked.</p>

<p>A knowledge that the health and strength of a person
depend largely upon what passes through his
mouth, that even the turn of his thinking is modified
by what he eats, should lead all intelligent women to
make food a conscientious subject of study.</p>

<p>In general, by the term "nutrition" is meant the
building up and maintaining of the physical framework
of the body with all its various functions, and
ultimately the mental and moral faculties which are
dependent upon it, by means of nutriment or food.</p>

<p>The word is derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nutrire</i>, to
nourish. The word "nurse" is from the same root,
and in its original sense means one who nourishes, a
person who supplies food, tends, or brings up.</p>

<p>Anything which aids in sustaining the body is food;
therefore, air and water, the two most immediate necessities
of life, may be, and often are, so classed.</p>

<p>Nutriment exclusive of air is received into the body
by means of the alimentary canal. The great receiver
of air is the lungs, but it also penetrates the body
through the pores of the skin, and at these points
carbonic acid is given off as in the lungs. The body
is often compared to a steam-engine, which takes in
raw material in the form of fuel and converts it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
force or power. Food, drink, and air are the fuel of
the body,&mdash;the things consumed; heat, muscular and
intellectual energy, and other forms of power are the
products.</p>

<p>Food, during the various digestive processes, becomes
reduced to a liquid, and is then absorbed and
conveyed, by different channels constructed for the
purpose, into the blood, which contains, after being
acted upon by the oxygen of the air in the lungs, all
those substances which are required to maintain the
various tissues, secretions, and, in fact, the life of the
system.</p>

<p>Some of the ways in which the different kinds of
food nourish the body have been found out by chemists
and physiologists from actual experiments on
living animals, such as rabbits, dogs, pigs, sheep,
goats, and horses, and also on man. Often a scientist
becomes so enthusiastic in his search for knowledge
about a certain food that he gives his own
body for trial. Much valuable work has been done
in this direction during the last decade by Voit,
Pettenkofer, Moleschott, Ranke, Payen, and in this
country by Atwater.</p>

<p>No one can explain all the different intricate
changes which a particle of food undergoes from the
moment it enters the mouth until its final transformation
into tissue or some form of energy; but by
comparing the income with the outgo, ideas may be
gained of what goes on in the economy of the body,
and of the proportion of nutrients used, and some of
the intricate and complex chemical changes which the
different food principles undergo in the various processes
of digestion, assimilation, and use.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
hundreds of changes take place in the body, in its various
nutritive functions, of which nothing is known,
or they are entirely unsuspected, so that if we do our
utmost with the present lights which we possess for
guidance to health, we shall still fall far short of
completeness. The subject of food and nutrition,
viewed in the light of bacteriology and chemistry, is
one of the most inviting subjects of study of the day,
and is worthy of the wisest thought of the nation.</p>

<p>The body creates nothing of itself, either of material
or of energy; all must come to it from without.
Every atom of carbon, hydrogen, phosphorus, or
other elements, every molecule of protein, carbohydrate,
or other compounds of these elements, is
brought to the body with the food and drink it consumes,
and the air it breathes. Like the steam-engine,
it uses the material supplied to it. Its
chemical compounds and energy are the compounds
and energy of the food transformed (Atwater). A
proof of this is seen in the fact that when the supply
from without is cut off, the body dies. The raw
material which the body uses is the air and food
which it consumes, the greater portion of which is
digested and distributed, through the medium of the
blood, to all parts of the body, to renew and nourish
the various tissues and to supply the material for the
different activities of life.</p>

<p><b>Ways in which Food Supplies the Wants of the Body.</b>
Food supplies the wants of the body in several ways&mdash;(1)
it is used to form the tissues of the body&mdash;bones,
flesh, tendons, skin, and nerves; (2) it is used to repair
the waste of the tissues; (3) it is stored in the
body for future use; (4) it is consumed as fuel to
maintain the constant temperature which the body
must always possess to be in a state of health; (5)
it produces muscular and nervous energy.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
amount of energy of the body depends upon two
things&mdash;the amount in the food eaten, and the ability
of the body to use it, or free it for use.</p>

<p>With every motion, and every thought and feeling,
material is consumed, hence the more rapid wearing
out of persons who do severe work, and of the nervous&mdash;those
who are keenly susceptible to every change
in their surroundings, to change of weather, even to
the thoughts and feelings of those about them.</p>

<p>We easily realize that muscular force or energy
cannot be maintained without nutriment in proper
quality and amount. An underfed or starving man
has not the strength of a well-fed person. He cannot
lift the same weight, cannot walk as far, cannot work
as hard. We do not as easily comprehend the nervous
organism, and generally have less sympathy with
worn-out or ill-nourished nerves than muscles, but
the sensibilities and the intellectual faculties, of
which the nerves and brain are but the instruments,
depend upon the right nutrition of the whole system
for their proper and healthful exercise.</p>

<p>So many factors enter into the make-up of a
thought that it cannot be said that any particular
kind of food will ultimately produce a poem; but of
this we may be sure, that the best work, the noblest
thoughts, the most original ideas, will not come from
a dyspeptic, underfed, or in any way ill-nourished
individual.</p>

<p>The classification of foods has been usually based
upon the deductions of Prout that milk contains all
the necessary nutrients in the best form and proportions,
viz., the nitrogenous matters, fat, sugar, water,
and salts; the latter being combinations of magnesium,
calcium, potassium, sodium, and iron, with
chlorin, phosphoric acid, and, in smaller quantities,
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>These different classes seem to serve different purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in the body, and are all necessary for perfect
nutrition. Some of them closely resemble each other
in composition, but are quite different in their physiological
properties, and in the ends which they serve.
For instance, starch (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) has almost the same
chemical formula as sugar (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>), and yet the
one cannot replace the other to its entire exclusion.</p>

<p><b>The Protein Compounds.</b> In general it may be said
that the carbohydrates are changed into fats, and are
used for the production of force, and that the fats
are stored in the body as fat and used as fuel. The
protein compounds do all that can be done by the
fats and carbohydrates, and in addition something
more; that is, they form the basis of blood, muscle,
sinew, skin, and bone. They are, therefore, the most
important of all the food compounds. The terms
"power-givers" and "energy-formers" are sometimes
applied to them, because wherever power and energy
are developed they are present, though not by any
means the only substances involved in the evolution
of energy. Probably the fats and carbohydrates
give most of the material for heat and the various other
forces of the body. In case of emergency, where
these are deficient, the proteins are used; but protein
alone forms the basis of muscle, tendons, skin, and
other tissues. This the fats and carbohydrates cannot
do (Atwater). The different tissues are known
from analysis to contain this complex nitrogenous
compound, protein. Now, since the body cannot
construct this substance out of the simpler chemical
compounds which come to it, it becomes perfectly
evident that the diet must have a due proportion of
protein in order to maintain the strength of the body.
We get most of our proteins from the flesh of animals,
and they in turn get it from plants, which construct
it from the crude materials of earth and air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Extractives</b>, usually classed with the protein
compounds, such as meat extract, beef tea, etc., are
not generally regarded as direct nutrients, but, like
tea and coffee, are valuable as accessory foods, lending
savor to other foods and aiding their digestion
by pleasantly exciting the flow of the digestive fluids.
They also act as brain and nerve stimulants, and perhaps
also in some slight degree as nutrients.</p>

<p>The principal proteins or nitrogenous substances
are <em>albumen</em> in various forms, casein both animal
and vegetable, <em>blood fibrin</em>, <em>muscle fibrin</em>, and <em>gelatin</em>.
All except the last are very much alike, and probably
can replace one another in nutrition.</p>

<p>Modern chemists agree that nitrogen is a necessary
element in the various chemical and physiological
actions which take place in the body to produce heat,
muscular energy, and the other powers. Every
structure in the body in which any form of energy is
manifested is nitrogenous. The nerves, muscles,
glands, and the floating cells<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in the various liquids
are nitrogenous. That nitrogen is necessary to the
different processes of the system, is shown by the fact
that if it be cut off, these processes languish. This
may not occur immediately, for the body always has
a store of nitrogen laid by for emergencies which will
be consumed first, but it will occur as soon as these
have been consumed. The energy of the body is
measured by its consumption of oxygen. Motion and
heat may be owing to the oxidation of fat, or of
starch, or of nitrogenous substances; but whatever
the source, the direction is given by the nitrogenous
structure&mdash;in other words, nitrogen is necessary to
all energy generated in the body.</p>

<p>Protein matter nourishes the organic framework,
takes part in the generation of energy, and may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
converted into non-nitrogenous substances.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The
necessity of the protein compounds is emphasized
when we realize that about <em>one half</em> of the body is
composed of muscle, <em>one fifth</em> of which is protein,
and the nitrogen in this protein can be furnished only
by protein, since neither fats nor carbohydrates contain
it. It is therefore evident that the protein-containing
foods, such as beef, mutton, fish, eggs,
milk, and others, are our most valued nutrients. Our
daily diet must contain a due proportion.</p>

<p>The proteins are all complex chemical compounds,
which in nutrition become reduced to simple forms,
and are then built up again into flesh. The animal
foods are in the main the best of the protein compounds,
for they are rich in nitrogenous matter, are
easily digested, and from their composition and adaptability
are most valuable in maintaining the life of
the body.</p>

<p>A diet of lean meat alone serves to build up tissue.
If nothing else be taken, the stored-up fat of the
body will be consumed, and the person will become
thin.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Athletes while in training take advantage of
this fact, and are allowed to eat only such food as
shall furnish the greatest amount of strength and
muscular energy with a minimum of fat. The lean
of beef and mutton, with a certain amount of bread,
constitute the foundation of the diet.</p>

<p><b>Fats.</b> Most of the fatty substances of food are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
liquefied at the temperature of the body. When eaten
in the form of adipose tissue, as the fat of beef and
mutton, the vesicles or cells in which the fat is held
are dissociated or dissolved, the fat is set free, and
mingles with the digesting mass. This is done in the
stomach, and is a preparation for its further change
in the intestines.</p>

<p>Fats are not dissolved&mdash;that is, in the sense in which
meats and other foods are dissolved&mdash;in the process
of digestion; the only change which they undergo is
a minute subdivision caused principally by the action
of the pancreatic juice. In this condition of fine
emulsion they are taken up by the lacteals; they
may also be absorbed by the blood-vessels.</p>

<p>It has been found that fat emulsions pass more
easily through membranes which have been moistened
with bile, and it is probable that the function of bile
is partly to facilitate the absorption of fat. That the
pancreatic juice is the chief agent in forming fats into
emulsion was discovered in 1848. Bile is, however,
essential to their perfect digestion, and we may therefore
say that they are digested by the united action
of the pancreatic juice and the bile.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Fat forms in the body fatty tissues, and serves for
muscular force and heat; it is also necessary to nourish
nerves and other tissues,&mdash;in fact, without it
healthy tissues cannot be formed. A proper amount
of fat is also a sort of albumen sparer.</p>

<p>It is probable that the fat which is used in the
body either to be stored away or for energy, is derived
from other sources than directly from the fat
eaten. From experiments made by Lawes and Gilbert
on pigs, it is evident that the excess of fat stored
in their bodies must be derived from some other
source than the fat contained in their food, and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
be produced partly from nitrogenous matter and
partly from carbohydrates, or, at least, that the latter
play a part in its formation. It would appear
from this that life might be maintained on starch,
water, salts, and meat free from fat; but although
the theory seems a good one, practically it is found
in actual experiment<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> that nutrition is impaired by a
lack of fat in the diet. The ill effects were soon seen,
and immediate relief was given when fat was added
to the food. Besides, in the food of all nations starch
is constantly associated with some form of fat; bread
with butter; potatoes with butter, cream, or gravy;
macaroni and polenta with oil, and so forth. A man
may live for a time and be healthy with a diet of albuminoids,
fats, salts, and water, but it has not yet
been proved that a similar result will be produced by
a diet of albuminoids, carbohydrates, salts, and water
without fat. Fat is necessary to perfect nutrition.
Health cannot be maintained on albuminoids, salts,
and water alone; but, on the other hand, cannot be
maintained without them.</p>

<p>Probably the value of fats, as such, is dependent
upon the ease with which they are digested. The
fats eaten are not stored in the body directly, but the
body constructs its fats from those eaten, and from
other substances in food,&mdash;according to some authorities
from the carbohydrates and proteids, and according
to others from proteids alone.</p>

<p>Fats are <em>stored away</em> as fat, <em>furnish heat</em>, and are
<em>used for energy</em>; at least, it is probable that at times
they are put to the latter use. The fats laid by in
the body for future use last in cases of starvation
quite a long time, depending, of course, upon the
amount. At such times a fat animal will live longer
than a lean one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>Doubtless in the fat of food the body finds material
for its fats in the most easily convertible form. Of
the various fatty substances taken, some are more
easily assimilated than others. Dr. Fothergill, in "The
Town Dweller," says that the reason that cod-liver oil
is given to delicate children and invalids is, that it is
more easily digested than ordinary fats, but it is an
inferior form of fat; the next most easily digested is
the fat of bacon. When a child can take bread
crumbled in a little of this fat, it will not be necessary
to give him cod-liver oil. Bacon fat is the much better
fat for building tissues. Then comes cream, a
natural emulsion, and butter. He further says there
is one form of fat not commonly looked at in its
proper dietetic value, and that is "toffee." It is made
of butter, sugar, and sometimes a portion of molasses.
A quantity of this, added to the ordinary meals, will
enable a child in winter to keep up the bodily heat.
The way in which butter in the form of toffee goes
into the stomach is particularly agreeable.</p>

<p><b>Carbohydrates.</b> The principal carbohydrates are
<em>starch</em>, <em>dextrine</em>, <em>cane-sugar</em> or common table sugar,
<em>grape-sugar</em>, the principal sugar in fruits, and <em>milk-sugar</em>,
the natural sugar in milk. They are substances
made up, as before stated, of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, but no nitrogen. They are important food
substances, but are of themselves incapable of sustaining
life.</p>

<p>The carbohydrates, both starch and sugar, in the
process of digestion are converted into glucose. This
is stored in the liver in the form of <em>glycogen</em>, which the
liver has the power of manufacturing; it then passes
into the circulation, and is distributed to the different
parts of the body as it is needed. (The liver also has
the power of forming glycogen out of other substances
than sugar, and it is pretty conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
proved that it is from proteids, and not from fats.
Carnivorous animals, living upon flesh alone, are
found to have glycogen in their bodies.)</p>

<p>It is impossible to assign any especial office to the
different food principles; that is, it cannot be said
that the carbohydrates perform a certain kind of
work in the body and nothing else, or that the proteids
or fats do. The human body is a highly complex
and intricate organism, and its maintenance is
carried on by complex and mysterious processes that
cannot be followed, except imperfectly; consequently,
we must regard the uses of foods in the body as
more or less involved in obscurity. It is, however,
generally understood that the proteids, fats, and carbohydrates
each do an individual work of their own
better than either of the others can do it. They are
all necessary in due amount to the nutrition of the
body, and doubtless work together as well as in their
separate functions. They are, however, sometimes interchangeable,
as, for instance, in the absence of the
carbohydrates, proteids will do their work. The carbohydrates
are eminently heat and energy formers,
and they also act as albumen sparers.</p>

<p>The body always has a store of material laid by for
future use. If it were not for this a person deprived
of food would die immediately, as is the case when he
is deprived of oxygen. (Air being ever about us, and
obtainable without effort or price, there is no need for
the body to lay by an amount of oxygen; consequently
only a very little is stored, and that in the blood.)</p>

<p>The great reserve forces of the body are in the form
of fatty tissues, and glycogen, or the stored-away carbohydrates
of the liver; the latter is given out to the
body as it is needed during the intervals of eating to
supply material for the heat and energy of daily consumption,
and in case of starvation. That they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
true reserves is shown by the fact that they disappear
during deprivation of food. The glycogen, or liver-supply,
disappears first; then the fat (Martin). The
heat of the body can be maintained on these substances,
and a certain amount of work done, although
no food except water be taken.</p>

<p>The principal function of the liver is to form glycogen
to be stored away. It constantly manufactures
it, and as constantly loses it to the circulation. Glycogen
is chemically allied to starch, having the same
formula (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), but differing in other ways. Its
quantity is greatest about two hours after a full
meal; then it gradually falls, but increases again
when food is again taken. Its amount also varies
with the <em>kind</em> of food eaten: fats and proteids by
themselves give little, but starch and sugars give
much, for it is found in greatest quantity when these
form a part of the diet.</p>

<p><b>Inorganic Matter and Vegetable Acids.</b> Water and
other inorganic matter, as the salts of different kinds,
and vegetable acids, as vinegar and lemon-juice, can
scarcely be said to be digested. Water is absorbed,
and salts are generally in solution in liquids and are
absorbed with them.</p>

<p><em>Water</em> is found in all parts of the body, even in the
very solid portions, as the bones and the enamel of
the teeth; it also constitutes a large proportion of its
semisolids and fluids, some of which are nearly all
water, as the perspiration and the tears.</p>

<p>Water usually is found combined with some of the
salts, which seem to act as regulators of the amount
which shall be incorporated into a tissue. Water is
a necessary constituent of all tissues, giving them a
proper consistency and elasticity. The power of resistance
of the bones could not be maintained without
it. It is also valuable as a food solvent, assisting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the liquefying of different substances, which are taken
up by the various absorbent tubes, conveyed into the
blood, and so circulated through the body. Most of
the water of the body is taken into it from without,
but it is also formed in the body by the union of
hydrogen and oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><em>Sodium chlorid</em>, or common salt, is found in the
blood and other fluids, and in the solids of the
body, except the enamel of the teeth; it occurs in
greatest proportion in the fluids. The part that this
salt plays in nutrition is not altogether understood.
"Common salt is intermediate in certain general processes,
and does not participate by its elements in the
formation of organs" (Liebig). Salt is intimately
associated with water, which plays an intermediate
part also in nutrition, being a bearer or carrier of
nutritious matters through the body.</p>

<p>Salt seems to regulate the absorption and use of
nutrients. It is found in the greatest quantity in
the blood and chyle. It doubtless facilitates digestion
by rendering foods more savory, and thus causing the
digestive juices to flow more freely. Sodium chlorid
is contained in most if not all kinds of food, but not
in sufficient quantity to supply the wants of the body;
it therefore becomes a necessary part of a diet.</p>

<p><em>Potassium chlorid</em> has similar uses to sodium chlorid,
although not so generally distributed through
the body. It is found in muscle, liver, milk, chyle,
blood, mucus, saliva, bile, gastric juice, and one or
two other fluids.</p>

<p><em>Calcium phosphate</em> is found in all the fluids and
solids of the body, held in solution in them by the
presence of CO<sub>2</sub>; both it and calcium carbonate enter
largely into the structure of the bones.</p>

<p><em>Sodium carbonate</em>, <em>magnesium phosphate</em>, and other
salts play important parts in nutrition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>The various salts influence chemical change as well
as act in rendering food soluble. For example, serum
albumen, the chief proteid of the blood, is insoluble
in pure water, but dissolves easily in water which has
a little neutral salts in it.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Salts also help to give
firmness to the teeth and bones.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, food is eaten, digested, assimilated,
and consumed or transformed in the body by a series
of highly intricate and complex processes. It is for
the most part used for the different powers and activities
of the system; there is, however, always a
small portion which is rejected as waste. The first
change is in the mouth, where the food is broken up
and moistened and the digestion of starch begins;
these changes continue in the stomach until the whole
is reduced to a more or less liquid mass. As the contents
of the stomach pass little by little into the duodenum,
the mass becomes more fluid by the admixture
of bile, pancreatic juice, and intestinal juice, and, as
it passes along, absorption takes place; the mass
grows darker in color and less fluid, until all good
material is taken up and only waste left, which is
rejected from the body.</p>

<p>That portion of the food which is not affected by
the single or united action of the digestive fluids is
chiefly of vegetable origin. Hard seeds, such as corn,
and the outer coverings of grains, such as the husk of
oatmeal and those parts which are composed largely
of cellulose, pass through the intestinal canal without
change.</p>

<p>It may be remarked here that since the digestive
mechanism is so perfect a structure, and will try to
dissolve anything given it, and select only that which
is good, why should there be the necessity of giving
any special attention to preparing food before it is
eaten? The answer is that the absorptive vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
cannot take up what is not there, neither can the
digestive organs <em>supply</em> what the food lacks; therefore,
the food must contain in suitable proportions all substances
needed by the body. Also, food which contains
a large proportion of waste, or is difficult of digestion
from over or under cooking, or is unattractive by insipidity
or unsavoriness, overworks these long-suffering
organs (the extra power or force needed being
drawn from the blood), and causes the whole system
to suffer. Mal-nutrition, with the long line of evils
which it entails, is the cause, direct or indirect, of
most of the sickness in the world, for it reduces the
powers of the system, and thus enfeebles its resistance
to disease.</p>

<p><b>Ideal Diet.</b> "The ideal diet is that combination of
food which, while imposing the least burden upon the
body, supplies it with exactly sufficient material to
meet its wants" (Schuster).</p>

<p>In general the digestibility of foods may be summarized
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The protein of ordinary animal foods is very readily and
completely digestible.</p>

<p>2. The protein of vegetable foods is much less easily digested
than that of animal foods.</p>

<p>3. The fat of animal foods may at times fail of digestion.</p>

<p>4. Sugar and starch are easy of digestion.</p>

<p>5. Animal foods have the advantage of vegetable foods in that
they contain more protein, and that their protein is more easily
digested. (Atwater.)</p></div>

<p>A diet largely of animal food leaves very little undigested
matter. The albuminoids in all cases are
completely transformed into nutriment. Fat enters
the blood as a fine emulsion.</p>

<p><b>Absorption.</b> The general rule of absorption is that
food is taken into the circulation through the porous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
walls of the alimentary tract as rapidly as it is completely
digested. A large portion of liquid is immediately
absorbed by the blood-vessels of the stomach.</p>

<p><b>Adaptation of Foods to Particular Needs and Conditions.</b>
The demands of different individuals for nutrients in
the daily food vary with age, occupation, and other
conditions of life, including especially the peculiar
characteristics of people. No two persons are exactly
alike in their expenditure of muscular and nervous
energy, so no two will need the same amount
or kind of nutriment to repair the waste.</p>

<p>A man who digs in a field day after day expends a
certain amount of muscular energy. A lawyer, statesman,
or author who works with his brain instead of
his hands uses nervous force, but very little muscular.
Brain and muscle are not nourished exactly by the
same materials; therefore, the demand in the way of
nutriment of these two classes will not be the same.</p>

<p>The lawyer might find a feast in a box of sardines
and some biscuit, while the field laborer would look
with contempt upon such food, and turn from it to
fat pork and cabbage. This is no mere difference in
refinement of taste, but a real and instinctive difference
in the demands of the two constitutions. Sardines
supply to the brain-worker the material he
needs, and the pork and cabbage to the laborer the
heat and energy he expends.</p>

<p>In health the sense of taste is the best guide to
what is demanded by the system, and may as a general
rule be followed; but in sickness that will not do,
as the sense of taste in particular is disturbed by
most forms of disease.</p>

<p>When a patient is very ill only the simplest foods will
be used, and those will be prescribed by the physician;
but when a patient is out of danger, and the necessity
for variety comes, then the nurse, by preparing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
suggesting dishes, may do much toward restoring the
person to health and strength.</p>

<p>As a very large percentage of diseases arise from
imperfect nutrition (as large as eighty per cent. being
given by some writers), the sense of taste is usually
very much disturbed and dulled in illness; therefore
those kinds of food which are savory, and at the same
time easy of digestion and nutritious, should be selected.
The savory quality is very important. A
person in health may endure badly cooked food and
monotony in diet; a person recovering from an illness
cannot but suffer by it.</p>

<p>A nurse will find a pleasant field for the exercise of
ingenuity in selecting and preparing such dishes as
shall (1) be suited to the digestive powers of the
patient; (2) shall be savory; (3) shall be sufficiently
varied to supply all those materials which the depleted
and exhausted body needs; and (4) shall be in
such judicious quantity as shall increase nutrition,
but never overtax the digestive powers.</p>

<p>The decision of No. 1 (food suited to the digestive
powers) is the most difficult, and here again the doctor
will advise for particular or peculiar diseases.</p>

<p>There are certain things which from their natural
composition are more easy of digestion than others,
such, for instance, as milk, eggs slightly coagulated
and raw, beef tea with the <em>juices in solution</em>, cocoa
milk, and cocoa, coffee, jellies, gruels, porridge from
prepared grains (except oatmeal) when <em>thoroughly</em>
cooked, oysters alive, rice, venison, and tripe.</p>

<p>No. 2, the <em>savory</em> quality, depends largely upon
preparation, and is under the control of the nurse. A
baked potato done in a <em>hot</em> oven, just to the point,
and served immediately, is a delicious dish; overdone,
or done in an oven of low temperature, and served
lukewarm, it is very far from appetizing. A steak, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
cut thin, salted, and broiled slowly, will be hard, dry,
and lacking in flavor, but if it is cut thick, at least an
inch and a half, better two inches, broiled for the first
minute over very hot coals, and then slowly, that the
heat may have time to penetrate to the center, and
raise the whole to a temperature sufficiently high to
cook it (about 160° Fahr.) without charring the outside,
it will make a dish both wholesome and savory.</p>

<p>No. 3, the next consideration, is that of <em>variety</em>, and
here the resources and judgment of the person in
charge must come to the front. Only general hints
can be given. Endeavor to supply some protein,
some fat, some of the carbohydrates, and some mineral
matter in each meal. Bread, grains, or potatoes
will give the necessary starch. Sugar is usually supplied
with drinks. Milk, eggs, meat, fish, and oysters
will give protein; cream, butter, bacon, and the fat
of other meats will furnish fat, and fruits and green
salads give acids and mineral salts. For the latter,
grapes, apples, carrots, onions, dandelions, and lettuce
are very valuable. Grapes are composed of water
with salts in solution, and glucose; both are absorbed
with very little outlay from the system. The others
are every-day foods, but science has taught that their
instinctive use in the past has been a wise one.</p>

<p>No. 4, the <em>quantity</em> of food to offer to a sick person,
will depend upon the individual. Give enough,
but rather give to an invalid <em>too little</em> than too much,
especially in the first days of using solid food; for
after some forms of sickness there is great hunger,
and one may injure himself by overeating at such a
time. Furnish a little of each kind of food, but let
that little be of <em>good quality</em> and <em>perfectly prepared</em>,
so that every morsel is eatable. It is discouraging to
any one to have set before him food such that much of
it must be rejected uneaten. It is very encouraging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
especially to an invalid, to be able to eat all that is
brought him, and for this end cooking and serving
are of great importance. It is necessary to adjust
the <em>proportions</em> of the different kinds of foods to
the needs of the consumer, otherwise all unnecessary
material will be rejected from the body as waste, or
will be accumulated in it to interfere with the workings
of the different organs.</p>

<p>In general it may be said that the needs of no two
individuals can be satisfied with exactly the same diet.
In sickness it is the province of the physician to adjust
the food to the condition of the patient. In convalescence
the taste of the individual and the judgment
of the nurse or attendant combined will usually not
fail of good results. If an individual craves a certain
dish, and there is no good reason why he should not
have it, by all means procure it. Let only your judgment
act. It may be something that you personally
do not like. That should not influence a decision,
provided, of course, that the food is not unwholesome.</p>

<p>We should bear in mind that a sick person is not
in the same condition as ourselves, and that no matter
how absurd his cravings may seem, they may be but
perfectly natural longings for those substances which
his depleted and exhausted system needs in order to
be restored to health.</p>

<h3 class="h3large">BEEF-JUICE, BEEF-TEA, AND BROTHS</h3>

<p><b>Beef-Juice.</b> The clear juice of beef, slightly diluted
with water, is always excellent, being especially useful
for its strong flavors. It is like concentrated
beef-tea, and is often valuable in pleasantly exciting
the action of the mouth and stomach after a long illness
in which milk has been the chief article of diet.</p>

<p>Beef-juice is best made by broiling the beef. Prepared
in this way, the flavor is superior, and it is a
quick and easy method; but when a proper broiling
fire cannot be had, then it may be made in a glass
jar like beef-tea, except without the water.</p>

<p><b>Beef-Tea</b> is valuable for its stimulating properties
and for the warmth that it gives; it is also somewhat
nutritious, containing as it does the albuminous
juices of the meat, some salts, and the very important
flavors. Beef-tea should be prepared in such a manner
that the juices are held in solution in the water,
not coagulated, to secure which the cooking temperature
should never be allowed to exceed that of 160°
Fahr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Broths.</b> Beef, mutton, and chicken broths are the
most desirable forms of meat drinks for convalescents
and those no longer dangerously ill. By slow cooking
at a low temperature at first (the temperature
should not exceed 150° Fahr. for the first hour), the
extractives and albuminous juices are drawn out;
then, by boiling, the gelatin of the bones, flesh, and
tissues is dissolved. The nutritive qualities of these
broths may be much increased by the addition of
bread, rice, tapioca, barley, and sago, cooked during
the whole time so that they may be completely dissolved
in the liquid.</p>

<h4>BEEF-JUICE</h4>

<p><b>Bottled.</b> Select a half pound of well-flavored beef,
cut away everything except the lean fiber, divide it
into small pieces, put them into a glass jar, cover,
and place in a deep saucepan of cold water; heat
gradually for one hour, but do not allow the temperature
at any time to exceed 160° Fahr.; then
strain out the juice and press the meat. The liquid
should be clear red, not brown and flaky. Add a
little salt, and it is ready to serve. A half pound
will make three or four tablespoons of juice. If it
is to be used constantly, a larger quantity may be
made at once, as it will keep eighteen hours in a refrigerator.
Beef-juice may be made into tea by diluting
it with warm water.</p>

<p><b>Broiled.</b> Prepare a fire of clear glowing coals from
which all blue flames have disappeared. Cut a piece
of lean beef (one half pound from the round or any
good lean portion) one and one half inches thick, and
remove from it all membranous tissues and fat. Put
it into a wire broiler, and broil from six to eight
minutes according to the intensity of the fire (see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rules for broiling). The piece when done should be
pink and full of juice, not dry and hard, nor, on the
other hand, bluish-red in the middle. More juice will
be obtained if the heat has penetrated to the center
than if the meat is raw. When done, cut it into small
pieces and squeeze out the juice with a meat-press or a
lemon-squeezer. Add a little salt, and it is ready to
serve. It should be given in spoonfuls, either warm
or cold. If it is necessary to warm it, put a little into
a cup and place it in a dish of warm water on the fire.
Care should be taken that the water does not become
hotter than 160° Fahr., for beyond that temperature
the albuminous juices become coagulated and appear
as brown flakes.</p>

<h4>BEEF-TEA</h4>

<p><b>Bottled.</b> Select and prepare the meat in the same
manner as for bottled beef-juice, except that for
every half pound a cup of water should be used,
poured over after it has been put into the jar. The
liquid thus obtained will resemble beef-juice in every
respect except in strength. Serve as a drink in a red
wine-glass or a china cup.</p>

<p><b>With Hydrochloric Acid.</b> Hydrochloric acid acts upon
the fibers of meat in such a way that they become more
easy of digestion. From a given portion of meat much
more nutriment is extracted by the use of hydrochloric
acid than without it; beef-tea made with it is recommended
by physicians as the most easily absorbed form
of beef drink, and for feeble children and patients
much weakened by sickness it is especially useful.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare.</b> Select a half pound of good beef; remove
from it everything that is not clear meat,&mdash;that
is, bone, gristle, connective tissue, and fat; chop it
fine on a meat-board or in a chopping-tray. Put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
into a bowl one cup of water and five drops of dilute
hydrochloric acid; stir into this the chopped meat,
and set it in a refrigerator or any cool place for two
hours to digest. Then strain, flavor with salt, and
serve cold in a red wine-glass.</p>

<p>Should there be any objection to the taste or color,
heat the tea until it steams and changes to a brownish
hue; do not strain out the flakes of coagulated
albumen and fibrin which appear, for they are the
most nutritious portion of the tea.</p>

<p>Chemically pure hydrochloric acid may be obtained
of a druggist (it is usually marked C. P.); from it a
diluted solution may be made by mixing it in the proportion
of five and one half fluid ounces to fourteen
ounces of water.</p>

<h4>BEEF BROTH</h4>

<p>Beef broth is the juice of beef extracted by the
long application of heat in connection with some solvent,
usually water.</p>

<p>To make beef broth, allow one pound of meat, or
meat and bone, to every quart of water. Wash the
meat with a cloth in cold water until it is clean, or
wipe it with a wet cloth if it is apparently fresh cut;
divide it into small pieces (half-inch cubes) in order to
expose as great an extent of surface as possible to the
dissolving action of the water. Put it into a granite-ware
kettle with <em>cold</em> water, and cook it at a low temperature
for two hours, then boil it for two hours to
dissolve the gelatin. Remove it from the fire, and
strain it, using a strainer so coarse that the flakes of
albumen may go through (an ordinary wire strainer
will do). Skim as much fat as possible from the surface
with a spoon, and then remove the remaining
small particles with a sheet of clean paper (unsized is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
best) drawn over the surface. Season the broth with
salt and pepper, and serve it very hot. If not needed
at once, it may be set away to cool, when the fat will rise
to the top, and form into a cake which may be lifted off.</p>

<p><b>With Herbs.</b> Make a broth according to the above
rule, and flavor it with bay-leaves, mint, or with a
bouquet of sweet herbs in the proportion of one teaspoon
to a quart of liquid.</p>

<p><b>With Grains.</b> One tablespoon of any of the following
grains&mdash;rice, barley, oatmeal, or wheat&mdash;to one
quart of liquid, gives a pleasant consistency and flavor
to beef broth. Tapioca, sago, cold dry toast, or
cuttings of bread may also be used. They should be
put in when the broth is first set on the fire to cook,
that they may be completely dissolved in the liquid.</p>

<p><b>With Vegetables.</b> Celery, onion, carrot, turnip, or
shredded cabbage may be used in broth in the proportion
of one tablespoon to a quart. Cabbage is
better in combination with onion than alone.</p>

<h4>BROTH MADE FROM BEEFSTEAK</h4>

<p class="pfs70">(A QUICK METHOD)</p>

<p>Scrape the pulp from a pound of round or of sirloin
steak, or mince the meat in a chopping-tray until it is
fine; put it into a saucepan with just enough cold
water to cover it, and let it come to the boiling-point
slowly; then simmer it for fifteen minutes (better
half an hour if there is time). Strain it, take off the
fat with a sheet of paper, and season it with salt. This
is a somewhat expensive but savory broth, and may
easily be made on a gas or alcohol stove.</p>

<p>A beef panada may be made by leaving the pulp in
the broth and adding a little rolled cracker-crumbs or
some bread softened and squeezed through a strainer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<h4>SCOTCH BEEF BROTH</h4>

<p>Put into a granite stew-pan a pint of prepared
beef broth,&mdash;that is, broth which has been strained,
cleared of fat, and seasoned. Add to it one tablespoon
of rolled oats, or of ordinary oatmeal, and simmer
it gently until the oatmeal is soft and jelly-like.
The time required will be about two hours. Then
strain it, and serve very hot. This makes a good dish
for an invalid for whom oatmeal has not been forbidden.
If the broth is reduced by the boiling, add
enough water to restore the pint.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN BROTH</h4>

<p>Chicken broth should be made with fowl, not with
young chicken; a good one weighing three pounds
will make three pints of broth.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare.</b> Singe the chicken with a piece of blazing
newspaper to burn off the long hairs; remove all
refuse or that which is not clear flesh, viz., pin-feathers,
oil-bag, crop, lungs, kidneys, and, of course, the
entrails if the fowl is not already drawn. If the pipes
in the neck are not all drawn out with the crop, they
may be easily taken away when the fowl is cut up.
Scrub it well in cold water, and then disjoint and cut
it into small pieces; wash each piece thoroughly, retaining
the skin if it is clear and free from pin-feathers,
otherwise removing it. Put the chicken into
cold water and simmer it for two hours, then boil it
for two hours. Finally strain it and remove the fat,
season it with salt and a bit of white pepper, and
serve very hot in pretty china cups, with or without
a lunch-cracker or a bit of dry toast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><b>With Herbs.</b> Parsley, bay-leaves, sage, thyme, or
a bouquet of sweet herbs will give a pleasant flavor
to chicken broth. A teaspoon to a pint is the right
proportion.</p>

<p><b>With Grains or Vegetables.</b> Rice may be used to advantage
in chicken broth, and also pearl-barley, sago,
tapioca, and bread. These are among the best additions
of the kind that can be made, for with them one
is able to preserve the light color so desirable in
chicken broth. Onion, celery, and parsley in the proportion
of one teaspoon to a pint are suitable vegetables.
Celery is especially nice.</p>

<h4>MUTTON BROTH</h4>

<p>One pound of mutton from the neck, or, better, the
loin, one quart of cold water, and one teaspoon of
chopped onion will be needed for this broth. Remove
from the mutton the tough skin, the fat, and all
membranes, and cut the meat into small pieces; break
the bone, and if it be a part of the spinal column, take
out the spinal cord. Put the pieces of meat, the onion,
and the water into a saucepan, and simmer them together
for three hours; then strain out the meat, dip
off the fat from the broth with a spoon, and remove
the remaining small particles with paper; season it
with salt and white pepper. Serve hot in a pretty
cup, with a toasted cracker.</p>

<p>A little bunch of mint, a bouquet of herbs, a few
bay-leaves, or a sprinkle of Cayenne pepper or curry-powder
will vary the broth agreeably. Pearl-barley
is a particularly good addition to make, or rice may
be used in the proportion of one teaspoon to a pint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h4>OYSTER-TEA. No. 1</h4>

<p>Select eight fresh oysters, chop them fine in a chopping-tray,
and turn them into a saucepan with a cup
of cold water; set the saucepan on the fire, and let
the water come slowly to the boiling-point, then simmer
for five minutes; strain the liquid into a bowl,
flavor it with half a saltspoon of salt, and serve hot
with or without a small piece of dry toast, or a
toasted cream-cracker.</p>

<h4>OYSTER-TEA. No. 2</h4>

<p>Put a dozen large oysters with their liquor into a
stew-pan; simmer for five minutes. Then strain the
liquor, leaving out the oysters, and add to it one half
cup of milk; set it back on the stove and heat it just
to the boiling-point. Flavor with a sprinkle of white
pepper and half a saltspoon of salt. Or make it according
to rule No. 1, using milk instead of water.</p>

<h4>CLAM BROTH</h4>

<p>Six large clams in their shells and a cup of water
will be needed for this broth. Wash the clams thoroughly
with a brush, and place them with the water
in a kettle over the fire. The broth is simply the
juice of the clams with the water boiled for a minute.
It does not require seasoning, as clam-juice is usually
salt enough. As soon as the shells open, the broth is
done.</p>

<p>This broth and oyster-tea No. 1 are good in cases
of nausea, and will be retained on the stomach when
almost everything else is rejected.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">GRUELS</h3>

<p>Gruels are cooked mixtures of grain or flour, with
water, or with water and milk. They are best made
with milk as a part of the liquid, but care must be
taken not to put it into the gruel until the grain has
been thoroughly cooked in water, and after that the
mixture should not be allowed to boil, as so high a
temperature changes the flavor and composition of
the milk, and renders it a less desirable food than
if it were cooked at a lower temperature,&mdash;for instance,
190° or 200° Fahr.</p>

<p>The largest ingredient of grains is starch, which
is not easily digested unless well cooked; therefore
the time for boiling gruels should be conscientiously
kept by the clock. Should the water evaporate, restore
to the original quantity before putting in the
milk, which should be hot, though not <em>boiling</em>. It may,
however, come just to the boiling-point without any
special injury.</p>

<p>Gruels served with a cream- or a banquet-cracker
or a square of toasted bread are excellent for a convalescent's
lunch. They may be varied with flavorings
of cinnamon, nutmeg, almond, or a little grated
lemon-peel, and sugar. Sugar is mentioned with
great hesitancy, for a sweet gruel is an abomination,
and yet a gruel with a <em>very little</em> sugar has a pleasanter
flavor than one without any.</p>

<p>Lacking color, gruels may be made attractive by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
serving them in dainty-hued china. Gruels should
be drunk slowly, that the starch, which is partially
digested by the action of saliva, may be thoroughly
mixed with it before it is swallowed.</p>

<h4>BARLEY GRUEL</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of Robinson's barley-flour.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Scant teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the flour, salt, and sugar together with a little
cold water, pour on the boiling water, and boil ten
minutes; then add the milk, bring just to the boiling-point,
strain, and serve very hot. This gruel may be
made without the milk, but with a pint instead of a
cup of water. Barley is a nutritious grain, rich in
phosphates and protein.</p>

<h4>ARROWROOT GRUEL</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of arrowroot.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Scant teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of hot water.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Wet the arrowroot with the sugar and salt in two
tablespoons of cold water, then pour on the <em>hot</em> water,
stirring constantly. Boil it for twenty minutes, then
add the milk and bring just to the boiling-point.
Strain it, and immediately serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrowroot is almost pure starch. Its grains burst
at 140° Fahr.; therefore, if <em>boiling</em> water be poured
upon it, it will form into lumps which will have to be
strained out, and thus a part of the material will be
lost; hence the necessity of wetting it in cold water to
reduce the temperature so that it may be stirred
smooth before the lumps form.</p>

<p>Milk is changed by long boiling, and loses some of
its agreeable taste; it is better, therefore, not to put
the milk into the gruel until after the flour has been
thoroughly cooked in the water, thus preserving its
natural flavor.</p>

<p>Arrowroot gruel may be flavored with cinnamon
by boiling a half square inch of cinnamon bark in the
water with which the gruel is made. Nutmeg, lemon
juice or peel, and sherry wine may also be used; but
the sherry should be avoided unless the gruel is to be
served cold.</p>

<h4>OATMEAL GRUEL FROM POUNDED GRAIN</h4>

<p>Pound in a mortar or roll on a bread-board one cup
of oatmeal until it is floury. Put it into a bowl, and
fill the bowl with cold water; stir well and let it settle
for a few seconds; then pour off the milky-looking
water into a saucepan, fill again, mix and pour off the
water, and so continue until the water no longer appears
white, being careful at each pouring not to allow
the brown cortex of the grain or any of the coarse
portions to get out of the bowl; then boil the water
for half an hour. For every pint put in a saltspoon
of salt and half a cup of sweet cream, or, if that is not
at hand, the same quantity of milk. Beef broth or wine
may be used instead of cream. This is the best way
to make oatmeal gruel, for by this method the coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and irritating hulls are excluded, while the good flavor
and nutritious properties are preserved.</p>

<h4>OATMEAL GRUEL (Plain)</h4>

<div class="recipe">
2 Tablespoons of oatmeal (rolled oats).<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Scant teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Cupful of boiling water.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the oatmeal, salt, and sugar together, and pour
on the boiling water. Cook it in a saucepan for thirty
minutes, or in a double boiler two hours; then strain
it through a fine wire strainer to remove the hulls, put
it again on the stove, add the milk, and allow it to
heat just to the boiling-point. Serve it hot. Good
oatmeal gruel may be made from cold porridge, by
adding water, milk, and a little sugar and straining
it, or it may be served unstrained. Many like it so,
and it makes an excellent lunch.</p>

<h4>FLOUR GRUEL</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of flour.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of milk.<br />
½ Square inch of cinnamon.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the flour, salt, and sugar, as for other gruels,
into a paste with a little cold water; add the piece of
cinnamon and the hot water; boil it for twenty minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
slowly, so that it may not stick to the bottom of
the pan and burn; then put in the milk and bring to
the boiling-point. Strain it, and serve it very hot. If
the gruel is intended for a patient with fever, a little
lemon-juice is good in place of the cinnamon. Other
flavors may also be used, such as nutmeg, almond, and
vanilla.</p>

<h4>CRACKER GRUEL</h4>

<div class="recipe">
2 Tablespoons of cracker-crumbs.<br />
1 Scant saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Scant teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>To make the cracker-crumbs, roll some crackers on
a board until they are fine. Bent's water-crackers
are good, cream-crackers better; mix the salt and
sugar with the crumbs, pour on the boiling water,
put in the milk, and simmer it for two minutes. The
gruel does not need long cooking, for the cracker-crumbs
are already thoroughly cooked. Do not
strain it.</p>

<h4>FARINA GRUEL</h4>

<p>Farina is a grain which is carefully prepared from
the nitrogenous part of selected wheat, and is therefore
a better nutrient than rice-flour or arrowroot.</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of Hecker's farina.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix the grain, salt, and sugar; pour on the boiling
water, and cook ten minutes; then put in the milk,
boil for a minute, and it is ready to serve. Farina,
being partially prepared, does not need long cooking.</p>

<h4>IMPERIAL GRANUM</h4>

<p>Imperial Granum is a dainty, highly nutritious preparation
of wheat, very useful for invalids and children.</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of Granum.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the meal, salt, and sugar in a saucepan, pour
on the boiling water, and cook ten minutes; then add
the milk, and let it again reach the boiling-point, when
it is ready to serve.</p>

<p>Mush and porridge may also be made from this
grain for the use of children, for whom it is an excellent
food, being similar to farina, but more delicate
and easier of digestion. Imperial Granum may be
obtained at any pharmacy.</p>

<h4><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">RACAHOUT DES ARABES</span></h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of Racahout.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Cup of hot water.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the Racahout and salt into a saucepan, mix it
into a paste with a little cold water, and then pour on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the hot water; simmer for ten minutes. Have the
milk scalding hot in another pan, and when the gruel
has cooked the full time pour it in. Strain and serve.</p>

<p>Racahout is a compound consisting principally of
sugar, arrowroot, rice-flour, and French chocolate.
It makes a most appetizing gruel, and is quite nutritious.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Racahout des Arabes</i> is imported largely
from France. It may be obtained at any first-class
grocery store.</p>

<h4>INDIAN-MEAL GRUEL</h4>

<div class="recipe">
2 Tablespoons of corn-meal.<br />
1 Tablespoon of flour.<br />
1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
1 Teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Quart of boiling water.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the corn-meal, flour, salt, and sugar into a thin
paste with cold water, and pour into it the boiling
water. Cook it in a double boiler for three hours.
No less time than that will cook the corn-meal thoroughly.
Then add the milk, and it is ready to serve.</p>

<p>Use the fine granulated meal which comes in paste-board
packages, prepared for the table, and may be
bought of almost any grocer.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">MUSH AND PORRIDGE</h3>

<p><em>Mush</em> is meal or grain cooked in water to the consistency
of rather thin pudding. <em>Porridge</em> is like
mush, only thinner. The most important point connected
with the preparation of these is thoroughness
in the cooking. Made as they generally are of coarsely
ground or of rolled grains, they need long boiling to
soften the cellulose and to cook the starch properly.</p>

<p><b>Oatmeal.</b> Oatmeal should be cooked for at least
three hours in a double boiler. It is at its best prepared
the day before it is needed, and then reheated
as it is wanted. If it is done in this way, the flavor
is fine, and there is no danger that the grains will be
hard. When taken from the kettle, the oatmeal should
be of the consistency to pour, and on cooling it ought
to form into a tender, jelly-like pudding. Sometimes
oatmeal is cooked so that the grains are whole and
separate, but it is not easily digested so, and lacks the
delicious flavor which long cooking gives.</p>

<p>Oatmeal for those for whom there is no objection
to its use is a valuable nutrient, furnishing more for
the money than almost any other food.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Indian Meal.</b> Indian meal also requires many hours'
cooking. Even if it be in a single vessel and actually
boiled, not less than an hour and a half of exposure
to heat is safe.</p>

<p><b>Farina.</b> Farina having been already subjected to a
high degree of heat in its preparation, is thereby partially
cooked, and does not require as long a time as
the raw grains.</p>

<p>Mushes and porridges made from oatmeal, cracked
wheat, or any grain on which the tough outside covering
remains, are to be avoided in all cases of irritation
or disease of the alimentary canal, particularly
in diseases of the intestines, for the hard hulls are
very irritating to the delicate lining membranes.
Young children have exceedingly delicate digestive
powers, and are often made ill by coarse, starchy food.
For them it is always safest to use the prepared
grains, such as farina, granula, and Imperial Granum.</p>

<p>All of the grains given in these recipes may be
made into <em>porridges</em> by following the rules given for
mushes, except that a larger proportion of water
should be used. Porridges are like mushes, only
thinner.</p>

<h4>OATMEAL MUSH</h4>

<div class="recipe10">
½ Cup of rolled oats, or ½ cup of granulated oatmeal.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of boiling water.<br />
</div>

<p>Pick over the oatmeal, and put it into a double
boiler with the salt. Pour on the boiling water,
place the upper vessel of the boiler on the stove, and
boil two minutes. This effectually starts the cooking.
Then put the upper vessel into the lower, and cook
for five hours. The water in the under boiler should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<em>boil</em> during this time, and will occasionally need replenishing.
Serve the mush steaming hot with sugar
and cream, and baked apples, apple sauce, or tart jelly
if one is fond of something acid.</p>

<p>If rolled oats be used, three hours are sufficient to
cook it, but both kinds are best cooked the day before
they are needed, as long cooking improves rather than
injures the grain.</p>

<h4>FARINA</h4>

<p>Farina being a prepared grain and free from hulls
and waste, so large a proportion will not be required
to make a mush as of the raw grains.</p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;3 Tablespoons of farina.<br />
½ Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of boiling water.<br />
</div>

<p>Cook the mixture in a saucepan for twenty minutes
after it actually boils, or in a double boiler for one
hour. This is a delicious food for children, served
with cream, or milk, and sugar.</p>

<h4>WHEAT GERM</h4>

<p>Wheat germ is a delicate and nutritious preparation
of wheat. It is made so that by boiling for a
short time it is ready for the table, and makes a delicious
breakfast dish.</p>

<div class="recipe">
½ Cup of germ.<br />
½ Teaspoonful of salt.<br />
1½ Cups of boiling water.<br />
</div>

<p>Boil in a saucepan without a cover for half an hour,
or cook in a double boiler twice as long. The directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on the packages give a shorter time, but it is
extremely doubtful whether this grain can be wholesome
with the few minutes' cooking usually advised.</p>

<h4>IMPERIAL GRANUM</h4>

<p>Imperial Granum, cooked according to the above
rule, is always a wholesome and safe dish for children;
or it may be made into a very thin gruel, and used as
a drink instead of water.</p>

<h4>GRANULA</h4>

<p>Granula is a breakfast grain which has been partially
prepared by dry heat, and is almost cooked
enough to use. It is sometimes recommended that it
be prepared by simply boiling a minute in milk. It
is, however, both softened and improved in flavor by
boiling from ten to fifteen minutes in one and one
half times its bulk of water, with salt in the proportion
of a teaspoon to a cup of grain.</p>

<h4>CRACKED OR ROLLED WHEAT</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Cup of cracked wheat.<br />
1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
3 Cups of water.<br />
</div>

<p>Pick over the wheat, to remove any foreign substance
that may be in it. Put it with the salt and
the water (boiling) into a double boiler, and cook for
two hours. Serve with cream and sugar, either hot
or cold. If it is desirable to have it cold, it may be
molded in cups or small round jelly-molds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h4>INDIAN-MEAL MUSH</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Cup of corn-meal.<br />
1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
1 Quart of boiling water.<br />
</div>

<p>No. 1. Make the corn-meal and salt into a paste
with a little cold water, then pour in the boiling
water and cook it in a double boiler for five hours.</p>

<p>No. 2. Put the salt into the water, and when the
water reaches the boiling-point stir in the dry meal
by taking a handful and sprinkling it slowly through
the fingers. Use a wooden spoon for stirring. Boil
an hour and a half. Or, wet the meal in a little cold
water, and pour over it the boiling water. The most
important point is thoroughness in the cooking, which
should be done carefully so that the pudding may not
burn on the bottom of the dish. If the temperature
be regulated so that it just simmers, there will be little
danger of this. Serve with maple syrup, or with
cream.</p>

<h4>HOMINY MUSH</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Cup of hominy.<br />
1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
1¼ Quarts of water.<br />
</div>

<p>Put all together in a double boiler, and cook for
three hours. Add more water if the mush seems stiff
and thick; all preparations of corn absorb a great
deal in cooking, and hominy usually needs a little
more than four times its bulk. Hominy is exceedingly
indigestible unless well cooked, but sweet and
nutritious when subjected to a high temperature for
a long time.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">DRINKS</h3>

<h4>EGG-NOG</h4>

<p>Break into a bowl one egg, add to it a saltspoon of
salt and two teaspoons of sugar; beat it until it is
light but not foamy; then add one cup of <em>slightly
warm</em> milk&mdash;that is, milk from which the chill has been
taken (for it is not well to use that which is ice-cold)&mdash;and
one or two tablespoons of French brandy; mix
and strain it into a tall slender glass, and serve at
once. Egg-nog should not be allowed to stand after
it is made, for both the egg and the milk lose some of
their freshness by exposure to the air.</p>

<h4>MILK-PUNCH</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Cup of milk.<br />
2 Tablespoons of brandy.<br />
1 Teaspoon of sugar.<br />
A little grated nutmeg.<br />
</div>

<p>Sweeten the milk with the sugar, stir into it the
brandy, and mix thoroughly by pouring from one
glass to another. Then grate a bit of nutmeg over
the top.</p>

<p>Milk-punch is conveniently made with two tin cups;
the mouth of one should be smaller than the mouth
of the other, so that the one will fit into the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
In these the milk should be shaken back and forth
until a froth is formed. This does not add materially
to the taste, but rather to the appearance, and
thoroughly mixes in the sugar and brandy.</p>

<h4>WINE WHEY</h4>

<p>Warm one cup of milk to a little more than blood-heat,
or 100° Fahr., then pour into it one half cup of
sherry wine. The acid and alcohol of the wine will in a
few minutes coagulate the albumen, which may be separated
from the whey by straining. Do not squeeze
the curd through the strainer, but let the liquid drip
until it is all out. If it is necessary to make the whey
quickly, heat the milk to the boiling-point before adding
the wine.</p>

<h4>WINE WHEY WITH RENNET</h4>

<p class="pfs80">(SWEET WHEY)</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Pint of milk heated to 100° Fahr.<br />
1 Teaspoon of prepared rennet.<br />
2 Tablespoons of wine.<br />
</div>

<p>Stir the rennet and wine into the milk quickly, so
that the wine may not curdle the milk in blotches.
Let it stand in a warm place (on the stove-hearth, for
instance) for half an hour, and then separate the curd
from the whey by straining. This whey is excellent
for children with delicate digestion who need a little
stimulant. It is very good also as a drink for invalids
at any time.</p>

<p>Whey is the water of milk with the sugar and
various salts of the milk in solution in it. The sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
furnishes some nutriment, and the salts supply some
of the mineral matter needed in the body.</p>

<p>Whey may also be made with vinegar or lemon-juice.
These acids will act more quickly when the
milk is warmed before they are added.</p>

<h4>LEMONADE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Lemon.<br />
1½ Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
</div>

<p>Wash and wipe a lemon, cut a very thin slice from
the middle, and squeeze the rest into a bowl; then put
in the sugar, pour on the boiling water, and strain it.
When it has become cold, serve it in a tumbler with
the slice of lemon floating on the top.</p>

<p>Lemonade has a better flavor when made with
boiling water, though it may be made with cold water.
A few strawberries or raspberries may be put in, instead
of the slice of lemon; or it may be colored pink
with a little grape-jelly or carmine, and served with
a straw.</p>

<h4>MILK LEMONADE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
¼ Cup of lemon-juice.<br />
¼ Cup of sherry.<br />
1¼ Cups of cold milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Pour the boiling water over the sugar, and then put
in the lemon-juice and sherry. Stir it until the sugar
dissolves, add the cold milk, and stir again until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
milk curdles, then strain through a jelly-bag or
napkin.</p>

<p>This is a cool and refreshing drink, especially for
children.</p>

<h4>BRANDY-MILK WITH EGG</h4>

<p>Heat some milk in a granite saucepan for half an
hour to sterilize it, but do not let it boil; then pour
it into a pitcher, and set it aside to cool. When the
milk is cold, beat one egg with one tablespoon of
sugar until the sugar is well mixed; add to it two
tablespoons of brandy and a cup of the cold milk.
Strain it into a tall slender glass, and serve at once.</p>

<p>Heating the milk renders it perfectly wholesome
and much safer for an invalid than raw milk, and also
improves the flavor of the drink.</p>

<h4>SHERRY AND EGG</h4>

<p>Break an egg into a bowl, and put in a teaspoon of
sugar; beat the two together until the sugar is
thoroughly mixed with the egg, but not enough to
make the egg froth; to this add two tablespoons of
sherry wine, and a fourth of a cup of cold water,
mixing them thoroughly. Strain all into a tumbler,
and serve immediately.</p>

<h4>STERILIZED MILK</h4>

<p>The change which takes place in milk known as
"souring" is caused by the growth of micro-organisms
in it, which are killed by heat; therefore, to prevent
souring, milk must be subjected to a temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sufficiently high to insure their destruction. Some
micro-organisms are killed at 136° Fahr., but this
temperature cannot be said to destroy, or to inhibit
the growth of all bacteria commonly found in milk.
We must endeavor then to use such a degree of heat
as shall accomplish this without seriously injuring the
natural properties and flavors of the liquid. Authorities
vary on this point, some putting the temperature
as high as 212° Fahr., and others as low as 167°
Fahr. The author has found, in an experience of
two years in sterilizing milk every day, that 190°
Fahr. is, under ordinary circumstances, a safe and
easily practicable temperature to employ. With this
degree of heat the flavor of the milk is excellent.</p>

<p>The process is as follows: The milk is put into clean
glass flasks or bottles with small mouths which are
stoppered with plugs of cotton batting, or, as it is
sometimes called, "cotton-wool." These are placed in
a wire basket, and the basket immersed in a kettle of
warm water, the temperature of which is not allowed
to exceed 190° Fahr. As soon as the heat is at or near
that point the time is marked, and the milk is kept
at that temperature for one hour. Then the bottles
are removed, cooled quickly, and placed in the refrigerator.
If it is desirable to keep the milk an indefinite
time, the process should be repeated the second
day, and again the third day, a third sterilization being
necessary to insure success, since <em>spores</em> of organisms
may escape the first and even the second heating.</p>

<p>For all ordinary household purposes, however, and
as a safe food for the sick, heating once is all that is
necessary. Milk thus treated will keep in the temperature
of an ordinary room, even in warm weather, from
twenty to thirty hours. By using the small-mouthed
flasks very little scum is formed, and thus the valuable
albuminous portion is preserved in the milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Also, a small quantity at a time may be used without
disturbing the rest.</p>

<p><b>To Sterilize for Family Use.</b> Milk may also be preserved
by open sterilization in a saucepan or kettle
by the following simple process: Heat the milk until
a scum forms over it; keep it at, or near, the temperature
it then has for one hour, then pour it into a
thoroughly washed and scalded pitcher, cool it, and
put it into a refrigerator or some cool place. It will
remain sweet for twenty-four hours, and, unless the
weather be very warm, it will be good at the end of
thirty-six hours. Should it sour before the end of
twenty-four hours, it indicates that the temperature
was too low, or the time of exposure to the heat too
short. A chemist's thermometer costs but little, and
will be found very useful for testing milk. It should
be borne in mind, in this connection, that milk is not
rendered <em>absolutely</em> sterile,&mdash;that is, free from all possible
organisms and spores which may occur in it,&mdash;except
at a temperature of at least 212° Fahr., or even
higher.</p>

<p>Sterilized milk diluted with water is a nutritious
and wholesome drink for the sick. Of course the
water with which it is diluted should be boiled.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In hospital practice nurses have told me that patients
suffering from sleeplessness will often fall into
quiet slumber after drinking hot milk, and that not
infrequently the ordered hypodermic of morphine is
not needed when hot milk is used.</p>

<h4>MILK AND SELTZER</h4>

<p>Mix equal quantities of sterilized milk and seltzer-water.
Drink immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h4>MILK AND SODA-WATER</h4>

<p>Into a glass half full of fresh milk put an equal
quantity of soda-water. Use at once. This is an
agreeable way to take milk, and is a nutritious and
refreshing drink.</p>

<h4>TOAST-WATER</h4>

<p>Cut three slices of bread each a third of an inch
thick, and toast them slowly until very brown and
dry throughout; break them into small pieces, put
them into a bowl with a pint of cold water, and set
aside to soak for an hour; at the end of that time
turn it into a strainer or napkin, and squeeze out the
liquid with the back of a spoon. To the water thus
obtained add a little cream and sugar, and serve it cold
in a tumbler. It may also be served without the
cream.</p>

<h4>BARLEY-WATER</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of barley flour.<br />
1 Teaspoon of sugar.<br />
1 Teaspoon of lemon-juice.<br />
1 Quart of water.<br />
</div>

<p>Boil the flour, water, and sugar together fifteen
minutes, then add the lemon-juice, and strain.</p>

<p>Tamarinds may be used instead of lemon-juice for
flavor&mdash;two or three boiled with the water. Barley-water
may also be made by boiling two tablespoons
of barley (the grain) in a quart of water for one hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h4>RICE-WATER</h4>

<p>Pick over and wash two tablespoons of rice; put it
into a granite saucepan with a quart of boiling water;
simmer it for two hours, when the rice should be
softened and partially dissolved; then strain the liquid
through a fine wire strainer into a bowl or
pitcher, add to it a saltspoon of salt, and serve it
either warm or cold.</p>

<p>If a patient may take or needs stimulants, two tablespoons
of sherry or of port wine is an agreeable
addition, especially if the drink be taken cold.</p>

<h4>FRUIT-SODA. No. 1</h4>

<p><b>From Strawberries.</b> Remove the stems from one
quart of strawberries, and pick them over carefully.
Wash them under a stream of water in a colander,
gently, so that they may not be crushed; then put
them into a double boiler with half their bulk of sugar,
and heat for an hour or more until the berries are
soft. When this is accomplished, turn them into a
jelly-bag and drain until the juice has completely
oozed out, which will require two or more hours. Do
not squeeze them. Then put the juice into a saucepan
and, returning to the fire, heat it to a temperature
of 200° Fahr., and keep it at that temperature for one
hour. If a thermometer is not at hand, heat the juice
until it steams a little, but do not let it boil, for the
flavor is not nearly so delicate with the high temperature.
Then it may be canned or bottled for future
use. If the bottle be scalded and carefully sealed as
in preserving fruits, the juice will keep indefinitely.</p>

<p>The length of time that it remains at 200° is important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as it is a process of sterilization which takes
place, and the temperature must be maintained for a
given time or the desired result will not be accomplished.
The condition of the bottle also must be
carefully considered, as the thorough cleaning and
scalding is for the purpose of rendering it sterile.
This is most easily and thoroughly done by filling
the bottle with hot water and placing it in a kettle of
boiling water for half an hour.</p>

<p><b>To Use.</b> Dilute the juice with <em>cool</em> water (not iced
water) or soda-water in the proportion of one half
juice to one half water.</p>

<p><b>From Oranges.</b> The oranges should be peeled and the
seeds removed, and then treated in the same way as the
strawberries in the preceding rule, except that to every
quart of fruit the juice of two lemons should be added.</p>

<p><b>From Raspberries.</b> Employ the same method as for
strawberries.</p>

<p><b>From Currants.</b> The same as for strawberries, except
that three fourths of the bulk of the fruit of
sugar should be used instead of one half.</p>

<p><b>With Other Fruits.</b> Other fruits, such as apricots,
peaches, cranberries, apples, etc., may be used for
syrups, varying the water and sugar according to the
kind of fruit used. Apples, apricots, and peaches
will require half their bulk of water.</p>

<h4>FRUIT-SODA. No. 2</h4>

<p>Sprinkle two cups of sugar over one box of ripe
strawberries, which, of course, have been hulled and
washed, and set them away for three hours, or until
the juice has oozed out of the fruit and made a thick
syrup with the sugar. Strain the juice, bottle it, and
put it in a cool place. It will keep for three days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p><b>To Use.</b> Pour one third of a cup into a tumbler,
add two tablespoons of cream, and fill the tumbler
with soda-water from a siphon. This makes a delicious
and cooling drink.</p>

<p>Oranges, raspberries, currants, or any other juicy
fruit may be used for syrup, which is very palatable
when made from fresh uncooked fruits. These syrups
are useful not only for drinks, but for flavoring ice-creams
and pudding sauces.</p>

<h4>COFFEE SYRUP</h4>

<p>Make some strong coffee with two tablespoons of
the ground berry (Mocha and Java mixed), a little
white of egg, and one cup of boiling water. Simmer
together one cup of sugar and one third of a cup of
water for five minutes, then add to it one half of a cup
of the coffee. Strain and bottle it for use. This is
delicious with soda-water and cream.</p>

<h4>VANILLA SYRUP</h4>

<p>Make a sugar syrup by boiling together one cup of
sugar and one half of a cup of water for five minutes.
Add to it two or three tablespoons of vanilla extract.
It is to be used, like coffee syrup, with soda-water and
sweet cream.</p>

<h4>OTHER SYRUPS</h4>

<p>A variety of syrups may be made, besides those mentioned,
by using a sugar syrup like that in the above
recipe, and flavoring it with cinnamon, lemon, almond,
rose-water, chocolate, etc. All of the cooked
syrups will keep indefinitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h4>GRAPE JUICE</h4>

<p>Grape juice mixed with cold water or with soda-water
makes a pleasant and invigorating drink for a sick person.
The best grapes for the purpose are the blue varieties,
such as Isabellas, Concords, or Black Hamburgs.</p>

<p><b>To Make a Bottle of Juice.</b> Pick over (and wash if
they need it) one quart of grapes. Remove them from
the stems, and put them into a double boiler with
just enough cold water to cover them. Heat them
slowly until the juice oozes out and the fruit becomes
soft, which will take two or three hours. Then turn
the fruit into a jelly-bag made like a long pointed
pocket, draw the string at the top and hang it to
drain. Do not squeeze or press the bag, and use only
the juice which drips out, which will practically be all
that the grapes contain. To this add one fourth of
the quantity of sugar&mdash;that is, if there is a quart of
juice, put in one cup of sugar&mdash;and heat it until it is
quite hot, or to a temperature of 200° Fahr., and keep
it at that temperature for one hour, but do not let
it boil. Then pour it into thoroughly cleaned and
scalded hot bottles,&mdash;in other words, those which are
sterile. Seal the bottles with wax, and set them away
in a cool place.</p>

<p><b>To Use.</b> Mix equal quantities of juice and cold
water, and serve at once.</p>

<h4>FLAXSEED TEA WITH LEMON</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of flaxseed.<br />
1 Pint of water.<br />
1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
Juice of one lemon.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil the flaxseed one hour in the water; strain it,
and add the lemon-juice and sugar. The flaxseed
should be examined for little black grains which often
occur in it, and which injure the delicate flavor of the
drink. Serve this tea either cold or warm. It is excellent
for croup, or for any irritated condition of the
throat or lungs.</p>

<h4>APPLE TEA</h4>

<p>Wash and wipe a good sour apple, cut it into small
pieces, and boil it in a cup of water until it is soft.
Then strain the water into a bowl, add a bit of sugar,
and serve when cold.</p>

<p>If the apple is of good flavor this is a pleasant drink,
and may be given to fever patients, children with
measles, or whenever there is much thirst.</p>

<h4>KUMISS</h4>

<div class="recipe15">
&nbsp;1 Quart of perfectly fresh milk.<br />
⅕ of a two-cent cake of Fleischmann's yeast.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
</div>

<p>Dissolve the yeast in a little water and mix it with
the sugar and milk. Put the mixture into strong
bottles,&mdash;beer-bottles are good,&mdash;cork them with
tightly fitting stoppers, and tie down securely with
stout twine. Shake the bottles for a full minute to
mix thoroughly the ingredients, then place them
on end in a refrigerator, or some equally cool place,
to ferment slowly. At the end of three days lay
the bottles on their sides; turn them occasionally.
Five days will be required to perfect the fermentation,
and then kumiss is at its best. It will keep indefinitely
in a refrigerator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p><b>To Make Sweet Kumiss.</b> Ferment the kumiss mixture
for twelve hours in a temperature of 70° Fahr.,&mdash;that
is, the same degree of heat that is required for
raising bread.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to open a bottle of kumiss without
a champagne-tap, for the carbonic acid generated in
the fermenting liquid has enormous expansive force,
and will throw the contents all over the room if the
bottle be opened in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>In an emergency, however, the cork may be punctured
with a stout needle to let the gas escape. The
mouth of the bottle may then be held in a large bowl
or dish and the cords cut, when the kumiss will rush
out, usually, however, without so much force but that
it may nearly all be caught. It should look like thick,
foamy cream.</p>

<p>Kumiss is highly recommended as an article of sick
diet, being especially valuable for many forms of indigestion
and for nausea. Often it will be retained
in the stomach when almost anything else would be
rejected. It is partially predigested milk, containing
carbonic acid and a little alcohol, both of which have
a tonic effect.</p>

<p>True kumiss is an Eastern product made from mare's
milk, but in this country cow's milk is always employed.
Sometimes the term <em>kefer</em> is given to it, to
distinguish it from that made from mare's milk. It
may be obtained in nearly all pharmacies, but a better
quality can be made at home at slight expense.</p>

<p>Sometimes patients will object to taking kumiss, on
account of the odor, which is not pleasant to every one,
but it leaves a peculiarly agreeable after-taste in the
mouth, and one who has once taken a glass of it will
seldom refuse a second offer. The kumiss of commerce
sold under the name of "Cream Koumyss" is
an excellent preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE COCOA-BEAN</h4>

<p>The cocoa-bean is a product of the tropics. It is
dried, roasted like coffee, and cracked, or ground into
powder, for use. It is one of our best foods, containing
in good proportions nearly all the elements necessary
to nourish the body.</p>

<p>There are many preparations of the bean. The
most common, and those usually found in our markets,
are <em>shells</em>, <em>cracked cocoa</em>, <em>chocolate</em>, and <em>various forms
of powder</em>.</p>

<p><em>Shells</em> are the outer husk or covering of the bean,
and from them a delicate drink may be made with
long, slow boiling.</p>

<p><em>Cracked cocoa</em>, or <em>cocoa-nibs</em> as it is sometimes called,
is made by breaking the beans into small pieces.</p>

<p><em>Chocolate</em> is prepared by grinding the cocoa-bean
into powder, mixing it with sugar, and molding it
into blocks. There is some temptation on the part of
manufacturers to substitute foreign fats, corn-starch,
and other cheap materials for the natural ingredients
of the bean in the making of chocolate.</p>

<p>The powdered forms of cocoa generally contain a
good percentage of the bean except the fat, which is
always extracted. All Dutch brands are excellent.
Weight for weight, they cost more than some other
kinds, but so much less is needed to make a cup of
drink that they are really the least expensive.</p>

<h4>COCOA</h4>

<div class="recipe">
½ Teaspoon of any Dutch cocoa.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of boiling milk.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Put the cocoa and sugar into a saucepan, and pour
in the boiling water; cook for two minutes, then add
the milk, and let it heat just to the boiling-point.
When most other brands are used, as a general thing
a larger proportion of powder will be necessary. It
is therefore important to experiment with each until
it is found what amount will make a drink equal in
strength to the above. This valuable food is often
made so strong that ill persons cannot digest it.</p>

<h4>COCOA-SHELLS</h4>

<p>Put a tablespoon of shells into a pint of water, and
simmer for two hours; add one tablespoon of sugar
and a cup of milk, then strain out the shells, and it is
ready to serve. This is a mild and delicately flavored
drink, and may be used freely in cases of great thirst.</p>

<h4>COCOA-NIBS</h4>

<p>Boil one teaspoon of cracked cocoa in a pint of
water one hour; then add a cup of milk and a tablespoon
of sugar, let it heat to the boiling-point again,
strain out the nibs, and it is ready to serve.</p>

<p>It is necessary to <em>boil</em> cracked cocoa, otherwise you
will have a bitter infusion, lacking the good flavor
which is extracted by the higher degree of heat. This
is an instance in which a few degrees more or less
of heat make a great difference in the result.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE</h4>

<p>Put <em>one third</em> of a square (one ounce) of Baker's
chocolate, with one cup of boiling water and a tablespoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of sugar, into a saucepan. Set the saucepan
on the fire, and stir for a while, moving the piece of
chocolate through the water occasionally until it is
melted. <em>As soon as it boils</em> add a cup of milk, and
when it again reaches the boiling-point it will be
ready to serve. If chocolate is allowed to boil for a
length of time, separation of the fat from the other
ingredients takes place, rendering it indigestible.
Chocolate, if delicately and carefully made, is as nice
as cocoa, much more nutritious, on account of the fat
which it contains, and less expensive.</p>

<h4>TEA</h4>

<p>Tea has refreshing and invigorating properties very
comforting to one spent with toil. Its active principle
is theine, a crystalline alkaloid found in both
tea and coffee. Theine and caffeine were once supposed
to be different substances, but have recently
been found to be identical.</p>

<p>Tea is a valuable article of diet, though not a
direct nutrient. It is classed with the so-called "accessory"
foods, and, although not itself nutritious,
aids, by its good flavor and stimulating properties,
the digestion of other things. It is a nerve tonic, and
is quite valuable as a curative agent for headache and
some forms of indigestion. The slight stimulation
resulting from its use is unattended by any after ill
effects.</p>

<p>It is good for soldiers, hard-working people, travelers,
and others who are much exposed to the rigors
of climate.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fs80">From Prof. Mott's Chart on the Composition, Digestibility,
and Nutritive Value of Food.</p>

<p>Two of the most important points suggested by a
study of tea are the few adulterations and the great difference
between different varieties, comparing weight
and bulk. Some kinds of very cheap tea are adulterated
with sage and raspberry leaves, and leaves of
other plants dried to simulate tea, and often flavored
with essences to give an agreeable taste, but a vast
amount of the tea which is sold is pure. Adulterations
with chemicals are now rare, on account of the extensive
cultivation of tea and the large quantities sold.</p>

<p>Teas vary greatly in weight,&mdash;that is, a given bulk
of one tea weighs very differently from the same bulk
of another. This is especially marked in the comparison
of Oolong and Gunpowder.</p>

<p>Below are given the weights of a moderate-sized
caddy-spoon of each of these teas.</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl fs80">KINDS OF TEA.</td><td class="tdc"><em>Grains</em>.</td><td class="tdc"><em>No. of spoons<br />to the pound.</em></td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>From this it appears that Gunpowder tea, bulk for
bulk, is more than three times as heavy as Oolong;
consequently in using it only about one third as much
should be taken for a given amount of water. In making
the infusion teas should be weighed, not measured,
but it is not easily practicable in all households to do
so; however, it can always be borne in mind that the
closely rolled teas, such as Gunpowder, Young Hyson,
and Japan, should be used in smaller proportion than
those which are loosely rolled, like Oolong, English
Breakfast, and other black teas.</p>

<p>There is a popular notion that green teas are dried
on copper, but according to unquestionable authorities
it is an erroneous one. Green teas are dried quickly
so that the natural color of the leaves is preserved.
Black teas are dried slowly for many hours until a
sort of fermentation sets in, which causes the difference
in color, as pickings from the same plant may,
in the process of curing, become either green or black
tea, according to the method employed. Also, different
varieties of tea may be made from the same
branch by difference of treatment in curing, the aromatic
flavors, which did not exist in the leaves before,
being produced by the drying. Different varieties or
kinds of tea are also made from the same plant by
gathering the leaves at different ages.</p>

<p>Black tea should be black, but not dead black,&mdash;rather
of a grayish hue. No red leaves should be mixed
with it. It should be regular in appearance, each leaf
with a uniform twist, that is, in all except the "broken"
teas. The leaves of tea are gathered four times a year
by hand, and the finest kind is made from the tender
young buds. Young Hyson is made from the early
buds of April, and is noted for its mild, delicate flavor.</p>

<p>The principle most to be avoided in tea is the tannin,
which in any considerable quantity is injurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to health. It dissolves easily when tea is either
<em>steeped for a length of time</em>, or <em>boiled</em>. The important
point, therefore, is not to make tea more than a few
minutes before it is to be drunk, and not to boil it.</p>

<p>The principal kinds of tea in common use are
Oolong, Japan, English Breakfast, Imperial, Gunpowder,
and Young Hyson. Gunpowder, Japan,
Young Hyson, and Imperial are green teas; the others
are black.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare Tea.</b></p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Teaspoon of tea.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
</div>

<p>Fill a cup with boiling water, and let it stand a
minute, or until the cup is heated through. Then
empty it, put the teaspoon of tea into a tea-ball,
place it in the hot cup, and pour on the boiling water
slowly until it is full, leaving the tea-ball in for three
minutes. This will give you a delicious and fragrant
drink. If there is not a tea-ball at hand, use a small
strainer, holding it so that the tea is under water for
the required time.</p>

<p>The same principle is to be followed in making a
pot of tea, except that the time of steeping should be
somewhat longer. Scald the pot, which should be
either of silver, granite-ware, or earthenware, not tin.
Put into it the tea, in the proportion of one teaspoon
to a cup of water (one half pint), and let it infuse for
five minutes, but by no means allow it to boil, for boiling
dissipates the aroma, and extracts the tannin,
which is the injurious principle. Serve it in hot teacups
with loaf-sugar and cold cream or milk. I think
it is Miss Lincoln who says: "Never disgrace yourself
by serving that abomination, boiled lukewarm tea
in a cold cup."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Water for tea should be fresh, and soft water&mdash;that
is, water which is free from lime&mdash;is to be preferred;
by taking <em>one teaspoon of tea</em> and <em>a cup of water</em> as the
unit, any amount may be made; for instance, for a pot
of tea for five or six persons, six teaspoons of tea and
a quart and a half (6 cups) of water will be required.
The time of exposure to the heat is, of course, not
multiplied, the same number of minutes being enough
for a greater or a lesser amount.</p>

<p>In connection with the study of tea, it is a very
interesting fact that most authorities agree as to the
time of steeping. There seems to be the unanimous
opinion that <em>it should not exceed fifteen</em> minutes. Five
minutes is the usual time given for the average kinds
of tea, but for the fine, pure teas from eight to ten is
a wise rule to follow.</p>

<h4>COFFEE</h4>

<p>Coffee is a product of the East, where it has been
used since very ancient times. It grows on trees, the
fruit in clusters which singly look somewhat like
cherries, each containing two beans. Unroasted coffee-beans
are tough, and a drink made from them is bitter,
acrid, and very unpleasant. Coffee was brought
to western Europe in the seventeenth century, where it
seems to have immediately become a popular drink.
When coffee-houses were first opened in England,
they were opposed by the liquor-dealers, who claimed
that their trade would be spoiled. Its introduction was
also bitterly opposed by others, and even denounced
from the pulpit. It was regarded somewhat in the
light of a dangerous Eastern drug. From western
Europe it was brought to America, and at the present
time is the most extensively used food beverage in
the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The kinds in common use in this country are Java
and Mocha from the East, and the South American
coffees Rio, Santos, and Maracaibo. The soil and
method of cultivation influence the quality of coffee,
as does also the age of the beans. The longer the
beans are kept (unbrowned) the finer the flavor.</p>

<p>Coffee is adulterated with grains of different kinds,
chicory, caramel, carrots and some other roots, and
with pastes made to resemble the coffee-bean. The
use of chicory is prohibited by law, unless the mixture
be labeled "Mixture of coffee and chicory." Nevertheless,
its use is common, and in nearly all hotels
and restaurants coffee is flavored with it.</p>

<p>"The detection of the presence of chicory, caramel,
and some sweet roots, as turnips, carrots, and parsnips,
is quite easy. If a few grains of the suspected sample
are placed on the surface of water in a glass vessel,
beaker, or tumbler, each particle of chicory, etc.,
will become surrounded by a yellow-brown cloud
which rapidly diffuses through the water until the
whole becomes colored. Pure coffee under the same
conditions gives no sensible color until after the
lapse of about fifteen minutes. Caramel (burnt sugar)
of course colors the water very deeply. Dandelion
root gives a deeper color than coffee, but not as deep
as chicory. The same is true of bread raspings.
Beans and pease give much less color to the water
than pure coffee. They can be readily detected by
the microscope, as can roasted figs and dates or date-stones."
(Mrs. Richards, in "Food Materials and
Their Adulterations.")</p>

<p>Coffee is said to owe its refreshing properties to (<em>a</em>)
caffeine, (<em>b</em>) a volatile oil developed by heat, not contained
in the unroasted bean, and to (<em>c</em>) astringent
acids.</p>

<p>Coffee diminishes the sensation of hunger, exhilarates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and refreshes, and decreases the amount of wear
and tear of the system.</p>

<p>Its composition, according to Payen, is as follows:</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine whether coffee may be
classed as a food, but that it has value as an adjunct
to true nutrients there can be no doubt. There is
a general agreement among physiologists that coffee
is invigorating, that it aids digestion both in the
sick and the well, that it is capable of allaying or
retarding waste and thereby acting indirectly as a
food. But the mistake should not be made that coffee
will <em>replace</em> food. Coffee may be compared in its
effects on the system to beef-tea&mdash;it is valuable for its
flavors rather than for actual nutritious principles.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that coffee is most frequently
made in such a way that its valuable flavors are undeveloped
or destroyed. Care must be taken that
the roasting be not carried so far as to char the coffee-beans,
yet far enough to convert the sugar into
caramel, and to change the nature of the volatile oil,
so that the highest point of flavor will be reached.
This can be best accomplished in regular roasting-houses,
where the temperature and time may be
accurately measured.</p>

<p>It is best to get a supply of fresh roasted coffee
every day, but when this is not practicable, once in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
three days, or once a week, will do. Although theoretically
the roasting of coffee should be a part of its
preparation&mdash;that is, it should be roasted, immediately
ground, and made into drink&mdash;practically it is
very seldom done.</p>

<h4>COFFEE. No. 1</h4>

<p>A favorite mixed coffee is made with two thirds
Java and one third Mocha. It should be ground just
before it is needed. For a pot of coffee use the proportions
of one heaped tablespoon to a cup of water.
It is well to calculate the number of persons there are
to be served, and allow one cup (one half pint) for each;
this amount, with the milk or cream used, will make
two ordinary china cups of coffee. To the ground
coffee add a little yolk or white of egg, with a spoonful
of water to dilute it; mix thoroughly until all the
grains are coated over with albumen, then pour on the
boiling water, simmer for five minutes, and steep at
a temperature just short of simmering for ten minutes
more. The coffee is then done. It should be
served at once with <em>loaf-sugar</em>, and either hot or cold
cream, or hot milk. The coffee should be perfectly
clear and of fine color and flavor.</p>

<p>There are many methods of making coffee, but the
above, everything considered, seems the most desirable
for family use. One egg is enough to clear three quarts
of coffee, and both yolk and white are of equal value
for the purpose.</p>

<h4>COFFEE. No. 2</h4>

<p>For every cup of water use a heaped tablespoon of
coffee; soak the coffee overnight or for several hours
in cold water, then bring it to the boiling-point, and
let it simmer for a few minutes just before using.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
This is said to be the most economical method of making,
as more is obtained from the coffee by this treatment.
The flavor is certainly fine.</p>

<p>Long boiling dissipates the delicious aromatic oils,
and as probably these are the most valuable properties
of the coffee, the necessity of preserving them is easily
seen. Care should be taken not to boil coffee for more
than from three to five minutes, and simmer rather
than boil, so as to preserve as much as possible the fine
flavors which are so quickly dissipated by boiling; yet
the high temperature seems to be necessary to extract
the desirable properties of the bean. One must therefore
ever bear in mind the seeming paradox that coffee
should reach the boiling-point, and yet not boil.</p>

<p>We do not estimate highly enough the value of
flavors. It is a well-demonstrated fact among a few
persons that many dishes containing actual nutritious
principles are but partially or imperfectly digested,
because of their lack of good flavor, either
from want of proper preparation, lack of seasoning,
or poor cooking. There is no doubt that many people
suffer from indigestion after eating such food.</p>

<p>Use in coffee-making either silver, granite-ware, or
earthenware urns or pots, never tin. They should
be made <em>perfectly clean</em> before using, especial attention
being necessary for the spout.</p>

<h4>MULLED WINE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Egg.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Clove.<br />
¼ Square inch of cinnamon.<br />
½ Cup of wine.<br />
½ Cup of water.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Put the water and spice together in a saucepan, and
boil for ten minutes; then add the wine, and let the
liquid just reach the boiling-point; meanwhile beat
the egg and sugar in a bowl, and just at the moment
when the wine begins to boil, pour it slowly into the
egg, stirring constantly to distribute the heat throughout
the whole. Unless the weather is very cold, there
is usually enough heat in the boiling liquid to coagulate
the albumen of the egg slightly, but should this
not be accomplished, set it on the fire for a minute to
finish. When done it should be of the consistency of
cream. Do not let the wine and water boil for any
appreciable time, for boiling dissipates some of the
pleasant flavor of the wine.</p>

<p>Beer, ale, and porter are excellent, mulled in the
same way.</p>

<h4>COCOA CORDIAL</h4>

<div class="recipe">
½ Teaspoon of Dutch cocoa.<br />
Some boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;2 Blocks of loaf-sugar.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of port wine.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the cocoa and sugar into a china cup, and pour
directly upon them some boiling water, then add the
wine, making in all the usual amount called a cupful.
Serve at once. This is an excellent drink for those
who are chilled or exhausted, or to take after a bath.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">JELLIES</h3>

<p class="p1 pfs80">(FROM GELATINE)</p>

<p>Gelatin is always of animal origin. The gelatinous
substance obtained from apples, grapes, cranberries,
and other fruits is not gelatin; it is a different material,
derived by the action of heat from pectose, a
substance which occurs in plants and is closely associated
with cellulose. Unprepared <em>gelatin</em> is sometimes
distinguished in writing from the <em>gelatine</em> of
commerce by the difference of an <em>e</em> in spelling.</p>

<p>Gelatin enters into the composition of all, or nearly
all, the tissues of the body. The walls of the microscopic
cells of flesh are composed of it. It is found
also in cartilage, tendons, connective tissue, bone, and
in the larynx and joints. Spiders' webs and the thread
of silkworms are gelatin in a liquid state, which solidifies
upon exposure to the air. Another kind of
gelatin forms the framework of insects, such as the
locusts on which John the Baptist fed. It also forms
the true skeleton of lobsters, crabs, and shrimps.
The edible birds' nests of the Chinese are a delicate
kind of gelatin more digestible than some other kinds,
for it is made from the saliva of a swallow, and probably
contains pepsin. (M. Williams.)</p>

<p>The part which gelatin plays as a food is not well
understood. Many experiments have recently been
made by scientists on dogs and other animals, to test
the value of gelatin in this respect. From these experiments
the following conclusions have been drawn:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
1. That gelatin alone is not sufficient as a food. 2.
That although insufficient it is not worthless. 3. That
gelatin is sufficient to sustain life when combined
with other substances which would themselves be
wholly insufficient if given alone. 4. That gelatin
must always be flavored to render it digestible and
nutritious.</p>

<p>Mattieu Williams says: "It would seem that gelatin
alone, although containing the elements required
for nutrition, needs something more to render it digestible.
We shall probably not be far from the truth
if we picture it to the mind as something too smooth,
too neutral, too inert, to set the digestive organs at
work, and that therefore it requires the addition of a
decidedly sapid something that shall make these organs
act."</p>

<p>Gelatin dissolves easily in warm liquid. Albumen
coagulates under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>The gelatine of commerce is made from the tissues
of animals, particularly from the thick skin of certain
portions of the body and from the head and feet.
When well flavored and in a liquid state as in broths,
or of a tender consistency as in well-made jelly, it is
a most desirable food for the sick. Lemon and orange
juice, strawberry, raspberry, grape, and indeed any
fruit syrup, coffee, cocoa, vanilla, wine, brandy, and
Jamaica rum, and strong meat broths which have
been cleared, may be used for flavoring. The jelly
should not be made hard and tenacious, but tender
and jelly-like, though firm.</p>

<p>The phosphated gelatine which may be bought of
any grocer is delicious for wine jelly made according
to the usual rule for jelly, with the exception of
omitting the lemon. Chalmer's and Nelson's are other
well-known brands. All jellies made with gelatine
are excellent for invalids. They are especially valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in cases of disease of the intestines, such as
typhoid fever and inflammation of the bowels, because,
being digested and absorbed, for the most
part or entirely, in the stomach, those organs are relieved
of effort, at the same time that the system is
supplied with a nutritious form of solid food.</p>

<h4>WINE JELLY. No. 1</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp; ¼ Box of Nelson's gelatine.<br />
&nbsp; ¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
1¼ Cups of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp; ½ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp; ½ Square inch of cinnamon.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Clove.<br />
&nbsp; ½ Cup of sherry wine.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the gelatine and cold water together in a dish
large enough to hold the whole mixture; let it
soak for half an hour; then pour the boiling water,
in which the clove and cinnamon have been simmering,
over the softened gelatine, add the sugar
and wine, and stir until the sugar and gelatine are
perfectly dissolved; then strain through a fine napkin
into a granite-ware or earthenware pan or mold,
and cool it in a refrigerator or in a pan of iced
water. Wine jelly made from phosphated gelatine,
omitting the spice, is delicious.</p>

<h4>WINE JELLY (No. 2) WITH LEMON</h4>

<p>The same proportions and ingredients are to be
used as in the above recipe, except that the juice of
half a lemon should be substituted for the spice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<h4>LEMON JELLY</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp; ¼ Box of gelatine.<br />
&nbsp; ¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
1¼ Cups of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp; ½ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp; ¼ Cup of lemon-juice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Tablespoon of brandy.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the gelatine and water together in a dish, and
let them soak half an hour; then pour on the boiling
water, and stir until the gelatine is dissolved. Do
not put in the sugar and then pour on the boiling
water, as there may not be heat enough in making a
small quantity of jelly to dissolve both, but add the
sugar after the water, then the lemon-juice and
brandy. Strain it through a napkin and cool it in a
refrigerator or in a pan of iced water. Use china or
granite-ware molds, never tin, for the acid of lemon
acts chemically upon it, forming compounds that are
injurious to health.</p>

<h4>ORANGE JELLY</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Box of gelatine.<br />
¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
½ Cup of boiling water.<br />
½ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of orange-juice.<br />
&nbsp;Juice of half a lemon.<br />
</div>

<p>Soften the gelatine in the cold water by soaking it
for half an hour; then pour in the boiling water, stirring
as previously directed until the gelatine is dissolved;
add the sugar, orange-juice, and lemon-juice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the order in which they are given, stir for a moment,
and then strain the liquid through a napkin into
molds, and set it to cool. Use earthenware or granite-ware
molds, not tin. The point most to be observed
in making this jelly is getting the juice from the
oranges. The most natural way for one to do would
be to cut the oranges in halves, and squeeze them in
a lemon-squeezer, but that will not do, for the orange-oil
of the rind is extracted in such large quantities
as to destroy the delicate flavor of the jelly. The
proper way to do is to peel the fruit, cut it in pieces,
put them in a jelly-bag, and squeeze out the juice
with the hand.</p>

<h4>COFFEE JELLY</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Box of gelatine.<br />
¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
½ Cup of strong coffee.<br />
½ Teaspoon of vanilla.<br />
½ Cup of sugar.<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the cold water for half an hour;
then pour on the boiling water, and put in the sugar,
coffee, and vanilla. Strain it through a napkin into a
glass dish in which it may be served, and cool it as jellies
are usually cooled, either in a refrigerator or in cold
water, unless of course it is winter, when the jelly quickly
becomes firm in any cool place, or it may be molded.
Serve it with sweet cream and sugar, or, if it be
molded, with whipped cream arranged around the form.
The coffee should be strong, made with the proportion
of two tablespoons of coffee to a cup of water.</p>

<p>This delicious jelly is acceptable to most invalids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h4>FRENCH JELLY WITH FRESH FRUITS</h4>

<p>Make a wine jelly according to the recipe on page
122. When it has lost some of its heat, but before it
begins to thicken, pour into it a pint of carefully
picked and cleaned raspberries, distributing them
evenly through the liquid; then set it away in a cool
place, or in a refrigerator, to harden. This makes a
nice dessert when served with sugar and cream. Other
fruits and other jellies may be combined at the discretion
of the maker. Orange jelly with oranges and
bananas is very good.</p>

<h4>RESTORATIVE JELLY</h4>

<div class="recipe">
½ Box of gelatine.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of port wine.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of powdered gum arabic.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of lemon-juice.<br />
&nbsp;3 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;2 Cloves.<br />
½ Square inch of cinnamon.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the gelatine, wine, and spice into a double
boiler, or if one is not at hand, improvise one by
placing a bowl in a pan of water. Set the boiler on
the fire, and when the gelatine is dissolved, put in
the gum arabic, lemon, and sugar. Stir thoroughly;
strain it quickly through a fine napkin, and cool it in
a shallow dish, so that the layer of jelly shall be an
inch thick. It is to be cut into cubes, which may be
served two or three at a time, to be held in the mouth
until melted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHICKEN JELLY</h4>

<p>Clean a small chicken, disjoint it, and cut the
meat into small pieces; remove the fat, break or
pound the bones, and put all into cold water, using
the following proportion: <em>A pint for every pound of
chicken</em>. Heat the water very slowly at first, and
then simmer it until the meat is tender; it will require
three or four hours. Boil down to one half the
quantity. Strain it and remove the fat; then clear
it with an egg, and season it with salt, pepper, and
lemon. Strain it through a fine napkin, pour into
small cups, and cool. Parsley, celery, and bay-leaves
give a good flavor. A suspicion of red pepper is also
an addition.</p>

<h4>PUNCHEON JELLY</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Box of phosphated gelatine.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of cold water.<br />
½ Cup of hot tea.<br />
½ Cup of sugar.<br />
¼ Cup of Jamaica rum.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of brandy.<br />
&nbsp;5 Drops of almond extract.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the gelatine to soak in the cold water, and at
the end of thirty minutes pour on the hot tea; then
add the sugar, rum, brandy, and almond; strain it
through a fine napkin, and set it in a cool place to
become firm.</p>

<p>Phosphated gelatine is a delicate acidulated preparation,
very nice for wine, lemon, or puncheon jelly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
but it cannot be used for creams on account of the
acid, which curdles them. Some of the directions indicate
that it may be neutralized with soda; that,
however, should not be done, since there is no accurate
means of ascertaining how much acid there is in
a given amount, or how strong it is; consequently
there is no guide to the amount of soda required.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">TOAST</h3>

<p>The principal constituent of ordinary wheaten
bread is starch.</p>

<p>When starch is subjected to a high temperature, it is
changed into the easily digested substance dextrine.
In the ordinary cooking of a loaf of bread, the starch
in the outer layers is changed into dextrine, which
helps to give the crust of bread that peculiar, agreeable
flavor which we call "sweet." Slices of bread
undergo a similar change when toast is made.</p>

<p>To make toast successfully, one should endeavor to
convert as much as possible of the starch into dextrine.
To do this, cut the bread one third of an inch
thick, place the slices in a toaster, or wire broiler, and
dry them slowly, either in a moderate oven, or by
holding the broiler some distance from the fire. The
object is to give the heat time to penetrate to the center
of the slice before the outside has begun to change
color. If a sheath be formed over the outside at once,
the moisture will be shut in, and the middle of the
slice will be prevented from becoming sufficiently
heated to change its starch, for the temperature will
not rise much above 212° Fahr. until the water is
dried out. (Starch is changed into dextrine at 401°
Fahr.)</p>

<p>Toast that is clammy in the middle and blackened
on the outside is less wholesome than untoasted
bread. Great care should therefore be taken with
the drying. When this has been accomplished, lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the broiler a little nearer the coals, when the toast
will quickly turn a golden brown. An ideal piece
of toast is crisp and golden throughout. But many
will say that they prefer toast that is soft inside,
and that they cannot eat hard, dry toast. The ideal
piece of toast is not really so hard as it seems.
It breaks and crumbles very easily, and is quickly
moistened by the saliva. If one would persevere with
a slice, he would soon learn to prefer it to any other
kind; at all events, that which is soft inside should
not be given to the sick. It is better to make the toast
dry, and then moisten it, if need be, by dipping the
slices into hot water for an instant, but <em>do not soak
them</em>.</p>

<p>Dry toast should be served directly from the fire, if
possible. When this is not practicable, pile it on a
platter, cover it with a napkin, and put it on the hearth
or in the oven.</p>

<p>Toast is given in all slight cases of illness, because
it is so easily digested. The more thorough the conversion
of the starch, the more easily and perfectly
the system will manage it, for the change of starch
into dextrine, by the action of heat, is simply doing
outside of the body that which takes place in it in the
ordinary course of digestion, by the action of the digestive
fluids. Therefore, when this is accomplished
by artificial means, nature is spared so much energy.</p>

<h4>BUTTERED WATER TOAST</h4>

<p>Toast four thin slices of bread. Put into a shallow
pan a pint of water with half a teaspoon of salt. Dip
each slice quickly into the water, place it in a covered
dish, and spread it with butter, piling one slice above
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not let the bread <em>soak</em> in the water. Endeavor
to keep a suggestion of crispness in it, for sloppy,
sodden toast is not nice. Serve it <em>very</em> hot, with apple
sauce, sweet baked apples, or tart jelly. Water toast
is really delicious if care is taken to have it hot. It
will be eaten with relish much longer than that made
with milk.</p>

<h4>MILK TOAST</h4>

<p>Put a cup of rich milk into a saucepan, and place it
on the stove. While it is heating, toast three slices of
bread a delicate brown. Put them one at a time into
a covered dish, and when the milk is boiling hot season
it with a saltspoon of salt and pour it over the bread.
A little butter may be spread upon each slice before
the milk is poured over, but it is a more delicate dish
without it.</p>

<h4>CREAM TOAST</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Pint of milk.<br />
1 Tablespoon of flour.<br />
1 Tablespoon of butter.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
4 Large or 6 small slices of bread.<br />
</div>

<p>Make a white sauce with the milk, flour, and butter
according to the following directions. Pour the milk
into a saucepan, and set it on the fire to heat. Put
the butter and flour together in another saucepan,
place it on the fire, and stir gently until the butter
melts; let them bubble together two or three minutes.
The high temperature which the butter quickly
attains will thoroughly cook the flour in a short time.
Then pour in a little of the milk, and stir until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
two are mixed; add a little more milk, and stir again
until it bubbles; if at this point the mixture does not
seem smooth, lift it from the fire, and beat it until it is
waxy and perfectly free from lumps. Then add more
milk, stir again, and so continue until all the milk is
in. Let it simmer slowly until the toast is ready,
which should be made according to the rule for dry
toast. Then soak the slices in boiling salted milk
(four if from a large, and six if from a small loaf of
bread), arrange them in a covered dish, and pour the
cream, salted, between and over them. Irregular
pieces and odds and ends of bread may be used instead
of whole slices, and are very nice toasted in a tin
pan in the oven.</p>

<p>One precaution is necessary in making this dish;
that is, to soak the bread <em>thoroughly</em> in the boiling
milk, for the sauce or cream is too thick to soften it.
On account of the high temperature to which the
butter rises, the starch is more perfectly cooked in it
than if the flour were mixed with cold water and
poured into the boiling milk, as is sometimes done.</p>

<h4>FRENCH OR EGG TOAST</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Egg.<br />
1 Cup of milk or cream.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
3 Slices of bread.<br />
</div>

<p>Break the egg on a plate, and beat it with a fork for
a minute, or until the viscousness is destroyed. Then
mix in the milk and salt. In this mixture soak the
slices of bread until they are soft, lay them in a buttered
omelet-pan, and fry them slowly until a golden
brown. Then place a bit of butter on the upper side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of each slice, turn and brown that side. Spread a
little butter, powdered cinnamon, and sugar on each
slice and arrange them one above another in a covered
dish. Serve very hot.</p>

<h4>CROUTONS</h4>

<p><em>Crouton</em> is a French word which in English means
<em>crust</em>. The term was first applied to the paste of sawdust,
flour, and water in which the peasants of southern
France used long ago to inclose their pieces of
meat before roasting. After the meat was done the
crust was broken open and thrown away. The word
with us is applied to little cubes of buttered bread
which have been browned in the oven. They are used
in soups and stews, sprinkled in just before serving.</p>

<p><b>To Make Croutons.</b> Butter a slice of evenly cut
bread. Divide it into cubes that will be one third of
an inch on a side. This will necessitate cutting the
slice of bread exactly a third of an inch thick. Place
these little cubes on a tin plate, or shallow dish, and
put the dish on the grate in a moderate oven for
fifteen minutes. When done they should be light
golden brown throughout, crisp and brittle. Sometimes
cubes of bread are fried in fat to resemble
croutons, but unless done by a skilful hand they are
usually soaked with fat. Even at the best they lack
the delicate flavor of those which are buttered, and
browned in an oven.</p>

<h4>SIPPETS</h4>

<p>Sippets are evenly cut oblongs of bread delicately
toasted. They may be served as dry toast, or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
broiled birds or broiled oysters. They are also nice
for a lunch with a cup of tea or cocoa.</p>

<p><b>To Make Sippets.</b> Cut thin slices of bread, and from
them make oblongs one inch wide by four inches
long. Toast carefully so that they will not break,
and pile on a small bread-plate if they are to be
served dry.</p>

<h4>VERMICELLI TOAST</h4>

<p>Prepare a cream toast according to the rule on page
130, except arrange the slices on a platter and pour the
sauce evenly over them. Press through a coarse wire
strainer enough hard-boiled yolk of egg to lightly
cover it. It will fall in irregular, broken, crinkled
threads, somewhat resembling vermicelli, hence the
name.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">SOUPS</h3>

<h4>OYSTER SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of fresh oysters.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of milk.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of rolled cracker-crumbs.<br />
A sprinkle of pepper.<br />
¼ Teaspoon of butter.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the milk with the cracker-crumbs into a saucepan
on the stove; while it is heating pick over the
oysters on a plate, and remove any bits of shell that
may be among them. Have a hot omelet-pan ready
to receive them, and when the milk reaches the boiling-point,
put the oysters into the omelet-pan. Stir
and turn them until they become plump, or while
about sixty can be <em>slowly counted</em>; then drop the
oysters into the boiling milk, take it immediately
from the fire, add the salt, pepper, and butter, and
serve at once. The point which requires the most attention
is the cooking of the oysters in the omelet-pan.
Do not let them cook <em>quite enough</em>, as the milk
has sufficient heat to finish them. If too long exposed
to the heat, the albuminous juice becomes over-cooked,
and the oysters consequently tough and
leathery. For thickening oyster soup, two tablespoons
of white sauce may be substituted for the cracker-crumbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHICKEN SOUP</h4>

<p>Thoroughly clean a good fowl. Separate it at the
joints and cut it into small pieces. Put the meat into
a saucepan with three pints of water, and stew it for
two and one half or three hours, or until it becomes
very tender. Then take out the meat, let the liquor
continue to boil, and to it add one tablespoon of rice,
one tablespoon of finely cut onion which has been
fried with a bit of butter until soft, but not brown,
and three peppercorns. Cut the nicer portions of the
meat into small pieces, after removing all the skin,
gristle, and bone. Put these pieces, with one teaspoon
of salt, into the soup, and let all simmer until
the rice is very soft. Then take out the peppercorns.
A very little white pepper and a little celery-salt or
curry-powder may be added. Serve hot with croutons.
If the water boils away during the cooking,
which it will do unless the simmering is very gentle,
restore the quantity.</p>

<h4>MOCK-BISQUE SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of tomatoes, measured after they<br />
<span class="pad2">have been stewed and strained.</span><br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of white sauce.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
¼ Saltspoon of pepper.<br />
½ Saltspoon of soda.<br />
</div>

<p>Although mock-bisque soup is better made with
fresh tomatoes, the canned fruit may be used, with
the precaution that it be allowed to stew only just
long enough to soften it through, for long boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
develops in it a very strong acid. When the tomatoes
are soft, strain them through a soup-strainer, or
other coarse wire strainer, until there is nothing left
but the seeds. Measure a pint of the liquid, add the
soda, salt, and pepper, and set it on the stove to heat
slowly. Meanwhile make a white sauce with one tablespoon
of butter, one of flour, and a pint of milk,
according to the rule on <a href="#Page_130">page 130</a>. Add this sauce to
the tomato, strain all into a double boiler, return to
the fire, and serve as soon as it becomes steaming hot.</p>

<p>If fresh tomatoes can be obtained, wash and wipe
them, cut out the green part near the stem, divide
them into small pieces without taking off the skins,
and stew without water until the fruit is just soft
enough to mash. If the tomatoes are fully ripe and
carefully cooked, they will not require the soda, but
when soda is necessary, fresh tomatoes need only half
the amount used for canned fruit.</p>

<p>This is an appetizing and delicate soup, and may
be freely used by most invalids.</p>

<h4>POTATO SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
3 Medium-sized potatoes.<br />
1 Teaspoon of chopped onion.<br />
2 Saltspoons of celery-salt, or 3 stalks of celery.<br />
1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
A little white pepper.<br />
A speck of cayenne.<br />
1 Teaspoon of flour.<br />
2 Teaspoons of butter.<br />
1 Pint of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Pare and boil the potatoes. Cook the onion and celery
in the milk, with which make a white sauce with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the flour and butter. When the potatoes are done,
drain off the water and dry them over the fire by moving
the pan back and forth on the stove to keep them
from sticking. Then, without removing the pan from
the fire, mash them thoroughly with a potato-masher,
and put in the sauce, pepper, cayenne, and salt; strain
all through a soup-strainer, and if the consistency be
not perfectly smooth and even, strain it again. Put
it into a double boiler, set back on the stove, and
when hot it is ready to serve. If the soup seems very
thick, add a little more milk, for some potatoes are
drier than others, and will consequently absorb more
moisture. It should be like a <em>thin purée</em>.</p>

<p>This soup may be varied by using a quart instead
of a pint of milk, and the whites of two eggs well
beaten, the latter to be added just two minutes before
it is removed from the fire, which will be sufficient
time for the egg to cook. Care should be taken not
to allow the egg to harden, or the soup will have a
curdled appearance.</p>

<h4>CREAM-OF-CELERY SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Head of celery.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of milk.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of butter.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of flour.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
½ Saltspoon of white pepper.<br />
</div>

<p>Wash and scrape the celery, cut it into half-inch
pieces, put it into the pint of boiling water, and cook
until it is very soft. When done mash it in the water
in which it was boiled, and add the salt and pepper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Cook the onion in the milk, and with it make a white
sauce with the butter and flour; add this to the celery,
and strain it through a soup-strainer, pressing and
mashing with the back of a spoon until all but a few
tough fibers of the celery are squeezed through. Return
the soup, in a double boiler, to the fire, and heat
it until it is steaming, when it is ready to serve.</p>

<p>By substituting chicken broth for water, and using
celery-salt instead of fresh celery when it is not in season,
a very acceptable variation of this soup may be
made.</p>

<h4>CREAM-OF-RICE SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Cup of rice.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of chicken broth or stock.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of sweet cream.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of chopped onion.<br />
&nbsp;1 Stalk of celery.<br />
&nbsp;3 Saltspoons of salt.<br />
A little white pepper.<br />
½ Saltspoon of curry-powder.<br />
</div>

<p>Pick over and wash the rice, and put it into the
chicken broth in a saucepan to cook. Simmer it slowly
until the rice is very soft. It will require two hours'
cooking to accomplish this. Half an hour before the
rice is done put the cream into a saucepan with the
onion, celery, pepper, and curry, and let them simmer
slowly for twenty minutes; then pour the mixture
into the rice; press all through a soup-strainer; add
the salt, and set it back on the stove to heat to the
boiling-point. It should be a rather thin soup, not a
<em>purée</em>. Should the broth boil away while the rice is
cooking, or should the soup be too thick, add more
broth, or some water.</p>

<h4>QUEEN VICTORIA'S FAVORITE SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of chopped chicken meat.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of strong chicken broth.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of sweet cream.<br />
½ Cup of cracker- or bread-crumbs.<br />
&nbsp;3 Yolks of eggs.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
½ Saltspoon of pepper.<br />
</div>

<p>The chicken may be obtained from what remains of
a roast, in which case the bones, skin, tendons, and all
the scraps left should be boiled for the broth. It is
better, however, to use a fowl which has been cooked
on purpose, as the broth from such a one is of finer
flavor. Soak the cracker-crumbs in a little of the
cream. Break three eggs, separate the whites from
the yolks, and carefully drop the yolks into hot water;
boil them until they are hard. Chop the chicken in a
chopping-tray until it is as fine as meal, previously
having removed everything except the clear meat;
mix the soaked cracker with it; press the hard egg-yolks
through a coarse wire strainer and put them in,
and also the salt, pepper, and broth. Then strain the
whole through a colander, adding the cream a little
at a time, and pressing through all of the meat. Boil
it for five minutes in a saucepan, or cook it in a
double boiler for half an hour. This makes a delicious
soup.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN-TAPIOCA SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of tapioca.<br />
½ Cup of cold water.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
&nbsp;1 Pint of strong chicken broth or white stock.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of milk.<br />
&nbsp;1 Stalk of celery, or some celery-salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of chopped onion.<br />
½ Square inch of mace.<br />
&nbsp;1 Scant teaspoon of salt.<br />
½ Saltspoon of white pepper.<br />
½ Teaspoon of butter.<br />
</div>

<p>The broth for this dish may be made by boiling the
bones of a roast with the left-over pieces of meat, and
then reducing the liquor until it is strong enough.
Put the tapioca to soak in the cold water, overnight
if it be the common, coarse kind, but if pearl or granulated
tapioca is used, twenty minutes will do. Then
add the chicken stock, and simmer it until the tapioca
is completely softened. It will require two or three
hours. About half an hour before the tapioca will be
done, put the milk, celery, onion, and mace into a
saucepan to cook, and as soon as the tapioca becomes
soft pour it in; remove from the fire, and strain the
whole through a wire strainer, forcing through with
a spoon all the grains of tapioca. Then add the salt,
pepper, and butter; set it back on the stove, and heat
it just to the boiling-point, when it is ready to serve.</p>

<h4>BEEF-TAPIOCA SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp; ¼ Cup of granulated tapioca.<br />
1½ Cups of water.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Pint of strong beef broth.<br />
&nbsp; ½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp; ½ Teaspoon of mixed sweet herbs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Teaspoon of minced onion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little black pepper.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Soak the tapioca for twenty minutes in a half cup
of cold water, then set it to cook in a double boiler
with the rest of the water (one cupful). When the
grains become soft and begin to look transparent, put
in all the other ingredients and cook until the tapioca
is completely dissolved. This will require two or
three hours. Strain it, and return it to the fire to
boil for five minutes, when it is ready to serve. This
soup may be made with the ordinary stock from a
stock-kettle. A little chicken broth is an improving
addition, and really makes a most savory soup.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN PANADA</h4>

<p>A panada is a dish the foundation of which is bread.
For chicken panada there will be needed:</p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of chicken meat.<br />
½ Cup of bread soaked in milk.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of chicken liquor or broth.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
¼ Saltspoon of pepper.<br />
</div>

<p>The chicken may be obtained from a cold roast,
the bones, gristle, and tendons of which should be
boiled for the broth, or a fowl may be used on purpose
for it.</p>

<p>Put the bread-crumbs to soak in enough milk to
cover them. Cut the chicken into small pieces, leaving
out everything which is not clear meat, and chop it
in a chopping-tray until it is very fine. Press the
bread-crumbs through a coarse wire strainer into it,
pour in the broth (from which the fat has been removed
by skimming with a spoon), and add the pepper
and salt. Boil for one minute. The panada should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
be about the consistency of thick gruel. It may be
varied by seasoning it with either celery-salt or curry-powder.
Two tablespoons of sweet cream is also a
desirable addition.</p>

<h4>CONSOMMÉ</h4>

<div class="recipe15">
&nbsp;3 Quarts of cold water.<br />
½ of a good fowl.<br />
&nbsp;2 Pounds of lean beef, or 2½ pounds of beef and bone.<br />
¼ Pound of lean ham.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of chopped carrot.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of chopped turnip.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of minced onion.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of celery.<br />
&nbsp;3 Cloves.<br />
&nbsp;3 Peppercorns.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of mixed sweet herbs.<br />
</div>

<p>Wipe but do not wash the beef, unless, of course, it
is very dirty. Cut it into small slices, and fry it in a
hot frying-pan to brown it and to develop the flavor
of the meat. Then divide the slices into small pieces,
so as to expose as large a surface as possible to the
action of the water. Put it, with the chicken (after it
has been cleaned and cut into small pieces), into a
porcelain-lined or granite-ware soup-digester, with the
piece of ham and three quarts of cold water. Let it
slowly reach the boiling-point, and simmer it gently
for six hours. Boiling briskly dissipates the flavors
by separating certain subtle substances which are perceptible
to the sense of smell, and if they are in the air
they cannot also be in the broth.</p>

<p>When it has been cooking for three hours, fry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
carrot, turnip, and onion together in a little butter
until they are brown, and put them with the cloves,
sweet herbs, peppercorns, and celery into the soup. If
these are cooked with the meat from the beginning,
the flavor is not so good.</p>

<p>At the end of the six hours, when the meat is in
rags, strain the liquid into a china bowl, and set it
away to cool until all the fat rises and forms in a
cake on the top. It is a good plan to cool it overnight
when there is plenty of time. Every particle
of fat must be removed, and it is not possible to do
this unless the soup is cooled. <em>To clear consommé</em>
return it to the fire, and as soon as it becomes liquid
break into it two eggs, and stir slowly until the soup
begins to steam and the albumen of the eggs is coagulated.
The coagulum will entangle all the insoluble
matter; then strain the liquid through a napkin, salt
it, and heat it just to the boiling-point, when it is
ready to serve.</p>

<p>It should be perfectly clear, and of a golden-brown
color like sherry wine. If the color is not dark enough,
a little caramel (burnt sugar) may be added.</p>

<p>The above quantity of meats and flavoring should
give a quart of consommé.</p>

<h4>BOUILLON</h4>

<p>Make a plain beef broth according to the rule on
<a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>. To a quart of this add a pinch each of
thyme, sage, sweet marjoram, and mint (or enough to
make in all what will fill a teaspoon), and a teaspoon
each of chopped onion and carrot. Boil all together
until the broth is reduced to one pint. Strain, season
with salt and pepper, and serve very hot in covered
cups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<h4>APPLE SOUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
2 Cups of apple.<br />
2 Cups of water.<br />
2 Teaspoons of corn-starch.<br />
1½ Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
1 Saltspoon of cinnamon.<br />
A bit of salt.<br />
</div>

<p>Stew the apple in the water until it is very soft.
Then mix together into a smooth paste the corn-starch,
sugar, salt, and cinnamon with a little cold
water. Pour this into the apple, and boil for five
minutes. Strain it into a soup-tureen, and keep hot
until ready to serve. This is very good eaten with
hot buttered sippets.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">OYSTERS</h3>

<p>Oysters are a highly prized food, though why it is
difficult to say, as they are neither very easy of digestion
nor very nutritious. But they possess a delicate
insinuating flavor that is generally acceptable to most
palates, and probably are really valuable for the salts
which they contain.</p>

<p>The composition of oysters (Payen's analysis) is as
follows:</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Nitrogenous matter</td><td class="tdr">14.010%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Fat</td><td class="tdr">1.515%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Saline substances</td><td class="tdr">2.695%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Water</td><td class="tdr">80.385%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Non-nitrogenous matter and waste</td><td class="tdr">1.395%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl pad4">Total</td><td class="tdr">100.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>According to Professor Mott's Chart of the Composition,
Digestibility, and Nutritive Value of Foods,
from actual experiment the time required for the
digestion of oysters is as follows:</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdc wd15">Hours.</td><td class="tdc wd15">Minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Raw oysters</td><td class="tdc">2</td><td class="tdc">55</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Roasted oysters</td><td class="tdc">3</td><td class="tdc">15</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Stewed oysters</td><td class="tdc">3</td><td class="tdc">30</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This shows that they require a longer time than do
most kinds of fish, venison, beefsteak, tripe, soused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
pig's feet, eggs, and roast beef, all of which are digested
in varying times less than those mentioned.</p>

<p>Oysters are found in greatest perfection in the
Eastern States, and in the cooler waters of the western
Atlantic. The choicest varieties in the world
come from the shores of Long Island, and from the
Providence River. Chesapeake Bay is noted for the
abundance of its oysters.</p>

<p>Oysters are in season from September to May; during
the rest of the year they are insipid and unfit for
food, although they are sometimes used.</p>

<p>Convalescents often begin with fresh, sound oysters,
before they venture to try other kinds of solid
animal food.</p>

<p>Oysters may be used in a variety of ways, but
served raw and broiled slightly in the shells are perhaps
the two most desirable ways with which to
begin. Afterward stews and soups are recommended
on account of their liquid form and warmth, warm
foods being always so much more desirable than cold.</p>

<p>There are some points to be carefully observed in
preparing oysters for the sick. (1) Make every effort
to have the oysters alive when used. If this is impossible,
buy salt-water oysters as fresh as they can
be obtained of a reliable dealer. Many serious cases
of illness, and even death, have been caused by eating
oysters so long dead that poisonous substances had
formed in them. (2) Remember that oysters contain
an albuminous juice which increases in hardness with
an increase of temperature, just as the albumen of an
egg does. When oysters are cooked with reference
to this juice alone, they are also cooked in the best
possible manner with reference to their other ingredients;
therefore subject them to a low temperature,
and for a short time, bearing in mind that 160° Fahr.
is the cooking temperature of albumen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<h4>RAW OYSTERS</h4>

<p>Wash and scrub the shells well under a stream of
water, with a vegetable brush. With a hammer break
the thin edges of the shell so that a knife may be inserted
to sever the muscle which holds the two parts
of the shell together; when this is cut remove the upper
half, and wipe the edges free from any grains of
sand. Then sever the muscle which joins the oyster
to the other half, so that it may be easily lifted out,
without the necessity of cutting. Arrange them on
an oyster-plate, and serve with salt, black pepper, and
lemon-juice. A half or a quarter of a lemon may be
placed in the center of the plate, which usually has
a groove on purpose for it.</p>

<h4>OYSTERS ROASTED IN THE SHELL</h4>

<p>Wash the shells very carefully with a brush. Put
them in a wire broiler over glowing coals, the round
side of the shell down so as to hold the juice. Cook
them quickly, turning once or twice until the shells
open. They may also be done in a hot oven. When
done, remove the upper half of the shell; season them
quickly with salt, pepper, and a tiny bit of butter,
and vinegar, if liked, and serve them while they are
very hot. The true oyster flavor is delightfully developed
by preparing in this way. They may also be
served with melted butter, seasoned with salt, pepper,
and lemon-juice.</p>

<h4>OYSTER SOUP</h4>

<p>See recipe under <b>Soups</b>, on <a href="#Page_134">page 134</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<h4>OYSTER STEW</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of oysters.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of rich milk.<br />
&nbsp;2 Saltspoons of salt.<br />
&nbsp;A little white pepper.<br />
¼ Teaspoon of butter.<br />
</div>

<p>Set the milk in a saucepan on the fire to heat. Prepare
the oysters by pouring over them a cup of cold
water to wash them, from which lift them out with a
fork, and search for bits of shell which sometimes adhere
when they are opened. Then lay them on a
napkin or a piece of clean cloth, to drain off as much
as possible of the water. Unless oysters are just taken
from the shells, the liquor is not of much value. Just
as the milk reaches the boiling-point, put the oysters
into an omelet-pan, which has been previously set on
the stove to heat, and cook them for a minute, or
until they become plump, turning them every ten
seconds with a fork. The moment the edges or frills
begin to curl, drop them into the milk and remove it
immediately from the fire. Now add the seasoning
and butter, and the stew is ready to serve&mdash;which
should be done as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Oyster stew may also be made by preparing the
oysters as above and then dropping them into boiling-hot
milk, which should remain for one or two minutes
on the fire before removal.</p>

<h4>CREAMED OYSTERS</h4>

<p>Clean a pint of oysters according to the directions
in the previous rule. After drying them on a napkin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
spread them on a plate and season them with salt,
pepper, and a suspicion of cayenne.</p>

<p>Make a rich cream sauce with <em>one pint</em> of cream,
<em>one tablespoon</em> of butter, and <em>two tablespoons</em> of flour.</p>

<p>When the sauce is cooked, roll into it the seasoned
oysters, put them in individual scallop-dishes, or a dish
such as might be used for scalloped oysters, or any
shallow baking-dish that is good enough to serve;
then bake them in a hot oven, on the grate, for ten
minutes if in small dishes, or for fifteen if in a single
large one. This gives time enough for the oysters to
become cooked but not hardened. The mixing of the
oysters and sauce should be done quickly, so that the
sauce may not become cold before they are put into
the oven; for if there is much delay, it will take longer
to cook them than the time given.</p>

<p>This is a good way to cook oysters for the sick, for
the sauce made according to the rule for such sauces
(<a href="#Page_130">page 130</a>) is easily digested, nutritious, and of good
flavor.</p>

<h4>BROILED OYSTERS</h4>

<p>Select large oysters. Drain them on a cloth or
napkin, turning them from one side to the other, to
make them as dry as possible. Meanwhile soften
some butter, and season some cracker-crumbs with salt
and pepper. Then, holding each oyster on a fork, dip it
into the crumbs, then into the melted butter, and again
into the crumbs. Arrange them in an oyster-broiler
(which differs from ordinary broilers by having the
wires closer together), and broil over a hot fire for
about two minutes, turning the broiler every few seconds.
They should not be shriveled, but plump, soft,
tender, and juicy. The salt and pepper in the crumbs
will sufficiently season them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h4>FANCY ROAST OR PAN-BROILED OYSTERS</h4>

<p>Eight oysters will be enough for one person.
Drain the oysters on a cloth or napkin, making them
as free from moisture as possible. Heat an omelet-pan,
with a small piece of butter in it, very hot; then
drop the oysters one by one into the pan, turning each
before the next is put in. One should work quickly,
otherwise the first will be overdone before the last is
put in. When the pan is full, shake it a moment, lift it
from the fire, and turn the oysters quickly into a square
covered dish, with toast-points in the corners. Season
them with salt, pepper, and a bit of butter, and
serve them as quickly as convenient.</p>

<p>Each oyster should be cooked so quickly that its
juices are shut into itself and do not ooze out into
the pan. There is usually a very little juice with the
butter, but if it is considerable, one may know that
the oysters have not been cooked in a sufficiently high
temperature. Oysters are very nice done in this way,
but it takes a skilful worker to do them without
letting the juice ooze out, or, on the other hand, over-cooking
them. The toast-points are made by cutting
small squares of bread diagonally across.</p>

<h4>OYSTER BROTH</h4>

<p>Chop a dozen oysters in a chopping-tray until they
are quite fine. Turn them into a small saucepan with
a cup of cold water, and let them slowly approach the
boiling-point, and then simmer them for five minutes,
the object being to get as much as possible of the flavor
of the oysters into the water. Then strain out the
oysters, season the liquor with a bit of salt, and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>A broth with milk may be made by putting in less
water, and adding milk three or four minutes before
the broth is taken from the fire.</p>

<h4>OYSTERS COOKED IN A CHAFING-DISH</h4>

<p>Chafing-dishes are generally made of silver, and
are much used just at present for cooking oysters
at the table. A chafing-dish consists of a covered
dish resting in a frame, and heated from below with
an alcohol lamp. It is brought to the table with the
lamp lighted and the raw oysters ready to be cooked.
Some member of the family takes it in charge, and
the result is a much more satisfactory dish than could
be otherwise obtained, for it requires intelligence and
a cultivated taste to cook and season these delicious
bivalves.</p>

<p><b>Uses of the Chafing-dish.</b> It may be used for broth,
stew, soup, and fancy roast, the treatment being exactly
the same as with a saucepan or an omelet-pan
on a stove.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">EGGS</h3>

<p>Eggs, next to milk, are the most valuable form of
food for those who are very ill. They contain in excellent
proportion most of the elements necessary to
nourish the body; but being a concentrated form
of food, it is well to associate with them milk or
some other liquid, and such starchy foods as bread,
potatoes, etc.</p>

<p>According to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Laws and Gilbert'">Lawes and Gilbert</ins> the composition of

<p>A large proportion of both yolk and white is <em>albumen</em>.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
It has been found by experiment (<a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>)
that when white of egg is subjected to a temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of 134°-140° Fahr. little white threads appear in it;
that if the temperature be increased to 160° Fahr.,
the whole mass becomes a white, but tender, easily
divided substance; that if the heat be raised to 200°
Fahr. it loses its tender, jelly-like consistency, and
becomes firm and tenacious; and that with continued
rise of temperature the toughness increases until at
from 300°-350° Fahr. it becomes so hard that it is
used as a cement for marble.</p>

<p>From these statements it will at once be inferred
that the proper cooking temperature of eggs is not
that of boiling water, but 52° lower. Eggs cooked
the customary three minutes in boiling water will be
overdone in the part nearest the shell, and not cooked
at all in the center of the yolk, as three minutes is
not long enough for the heat to penetrate to that
point. The yolk, though not injurious in this condition,
is not as palatable as when it is cooked. The
condition of the white, however, is of grave importance,
as even well persons are sometimes made ill by
eating it.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that although albumen will
coagulate at a temperature somewhat lower than 160°
Fahr., the degree of firmness obtained by exposing it
to this temperature is the most desirable for food.
Therefore we speak of 160° Fahr. as its <em>cooking temperature</em>.
An egg cooked ideally would be subjected
to that temperature for a sufficient time to allow the
heat to penetrate and act upon all portions of it. The
time required is half an hour. Cooked according to
this method, the white would be opaque and firm, but
tender and delicate, the yolk not liquid and lukewarm,
but thick and almost firm. The flavor of both is delicious.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the proper temperature necessary
to bring about this change is absolutely essential to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
any one who would cook eggs, and dishes which contain
them, such as creams, puddings, etc., as they
should be cooked. A great deal of the philosophy of
cooking depends upon this knowledge, for nearly all
kinds of meat, fish, oysters, milk, and other albuminous
foods contain as one of their most valuable nutrients
the substance known as albumen. When they are
cooked with reference to this <em>alone</em>, we find that they
are also done in the best-known way with reference
to their other ingredients.</p>

<p>Practically with our present kitchen appliances it
is exceedingly difficult to maintain for half an hour
a steady temperature of 160°, but excellent results
may be obtained by the following method.</p>

<h4>SOFT-COOKED EGGS</h4>

<p>Pour enough boiling water into a saucepan to more
than cover whatever number of eggs are to be cooked;
then put in the eggs, and let them stand for ten minutes
on the hearth or any place where the water will
not lose its warmth too quickly. Remember that it
is the heat in the water which is to do the cooking.
The saucepan should remain uncovered. Practically
this is an excellent way to do, for the amount of heat
in the water will not fall below 160° Fahr. in the ten
minutes, and that time is sufficient for it to penetrate
to the center of the egg. Moreover, if the egg be forgotten,
and remains in the water for a longer time, it
will not become hard unless the temperature of the
water be raised.</p>

<p>Theoretically an egg should be cooked at 160° Fahr.,
but practically this would involve a considerable
waste of time and necessitate the use of a thermometer.
Almost the same result is obtained in an easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and convenient way by the above method, although
it is not an exact one. The proportion of boiling
water for each egg which will insure cooking in the
time given is one pint, but somewhat less will do if
many are to be cooked; for instance, eight eggs will
do in six pints, as comparatively less heat is lost in
warming the pan.</p>

<h4>POACHED OR DROPPED EGGS</h4>

<p>From a thin, even slice of home-made bread cut out
a round piece with a biscuit-cutter; toast it a delicate
brown.</p>

<p>Pour some boiling water into a small saucepan and
salt it, using a saltspoon of salt to a cup of water;
place it on the stove to boil. Break a fresh egg into
a cup, and when the water is boiling slip it gently
into the pan. At first the egg will cool the water
below the boiling-point, but should the water again
begin to boil, withdraw the pan to a cooler part of
the stove. When the white is firm, or at the end of
about two minutes, lift out the egg by means of two
spoons or a skimmer (being careful not to break the
yolk), and place it on the round of toast. The egg
should not be trimmed. Season it with a speck of
salt, a little pepper, and a bit of butter placed on the
middle of the yolk. This is a dainty and easy way of
preparing eggs for the sick, and one is always sure
of the condition of the eggs, which is not the case
when they are cooked in the shell.</p>

<p>A layer of minced ham or of minced chicken laid
on the toast makes a palatable variation.</p>

<p>Egg-poachers, or little tin cups with perforated
bottoms set in a frame, may be bought for poaching
eggs, but in those that the author has seen the raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
albumen runs into the little holes and makes it difficult
to remove the egg after it is done without
breaking it. Muffin-rings may also be used.</p>

<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS. No. 1</h4>

<p>Break two eggs into a plate, and sprinkle on a little
pepper and a saltspoon of salt; beat them with a fork
for one minute, add two tablespoons of milk or, better,
thin sweet cream; beat again and pour the mixture
into a buttered pan; stir it gently, letting it cook
slowly for about two minutes, or until the albumen
of the egg is coagulated. It should be soft and tender,
not hardened. Serve it on toast, or in a small,
square covered dish.</p>

<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS. No. 2</h4>

<p>Beat two eggs, a saltspoon of salt, and a sprinkle
of white pepper in a bowl with a Dover egg-beater
until quite light; add two tablespoons of sweet cream
or of milk, and turn the mixture into a double boiler
to cook, stirring it constantly until the albumen is just
coagulated. A delicate and easily digested dish is the
result. It is a safer way to use the double boiler
rather than an omelet-pan. If no double boiler is at
hand, one may be improvised with a bowl or dish set
into a kettle of hot water.</p>

<h4>OMELETS</h4>

<p>Omelets may be made in a great variety of ways,
the kind depending not upon a difference in mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the eggs, but upon the ingredients which are added.
<em>Spanish</em> omelet is ordinary omelet with onion. <em>Truffles</em>,
<em>mushrooms</em>, <em>chopped oysters</em>, <em>rum</em>, and <em>tomato</em>
make other varieties. Flour should never be used in
them, as it cannot be properly cooked in the short
time that should be given to the eggs. If it should
happen that an omelet is to be made, and there is no
milk at hand, water may be substituted, but an omelet
should never be made without one or the other.</p>

<h4>CREAMY OMELET</h4>

<p>Beat four eggs slightly with a fork until you can
take up a spoonful; add two saltspoons of salt, half
a saltspoon of pepper, four tablespoons of milk or
cream, and mix well. Butter an omelet-pan, and before
the butter browns turn in the mixture. Then
with the point of a fork pick or lift up the cooked
egg from the center, and let the uncooked egg run
under. This leaves the butter on the pan, and is better
than stirring. Continue the lifting until the
whole is of a soft creamy consistency, then place it
over a hotter part of the fire and brown slightly, fold
and turn out as usual. (Adapted from Mrs. D. A.
Lincoln's "Boston Cook Book.")</p>

<p>For an invalid's use take half the quantities mentioned
above&mdash;that is, use two eggs, two tablespoons
of milk or cream, a saltspoon of salt, and a bit of pepper;
and instead of having the omelet-pan hot,
have it just warm enough to melt the butter; otherwise
the first layer of egg which is cooked may be
overdone and hardened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<h4>FOAMY OMELET</h4>

<p>Separate the yolks from the whites of two eggs, and
put them into bowls. To the yolks add a saltspoon
of salt and one fourth of a saltspoon of pepper. Beat
with a Dover egg-beater until light. Then add two
tablespoons of milk. Beat the whites until stiff, but
not as stiff as possible, and <em>fold</em>, not <em>beat</em> them into
the yolks, so that the whole shall be very light and
puffy. Pour the mixture into a buttered omelet-pan,
and cook slowly until the under side begins to
change color and become brown, or for about <em>two
minutes</em>. Then put the pan on the grate in the oven
for about <em>one minute</em>, to cook the upper surface. One
must endeavor to avoid both over and under cooking.
If the omelet is not done enough, the raw egg will
ooze out after it is folded; on the other hand, if it is
cooked too much, it will be dry and tough. When it
seems to be coagulated on the upper surface, run a
case-knife under it to separate it from the pan, and
fold one half over the other. Take the platter which
is to receive it in the right hand, lay it against
the edge of the pan, and tip the omelet out. Serve
immediately.</p>

<p>An omelet is a dainty and delicate way of serving
eggs, and may be well made by any one who will bear
in mind that the cooking temperature of albumen is
160° Fahr., and that if exposed to a very much higher
degree of heat for many minutes, it will be spoiled,&mdash;rendered
both unpalatable and indigestible.</p>

<h4>OMELET WITH HAM. No. 1</h4>

<p>Broil a thin, small slice of ham until thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
well done. Lay it between the folds of an omelet.
Either creamy or foamy omelets may be used.</p>

<h4>OMELET WITH HAM. No. 2</h4>

<p>Mince a piece of cooked ham until it is fine. Stir it
into an omelet in the proportion of one teaspoon to
an egg, or it may be sprinkled over the surface just
before folding. When seasoned with a little mustard,
it makes a very piquant addition. Either creamy or
foamy omelets may be used.</p>

<h4>OMELET WITH JELLY</h4>

<p>Spread a tablespoon of grape or currant jelly over
the middle of the upper surface of a two-egg omelet
just before folding it.</p>

<h4>OMELET WITH CHICKEN</h4>

<p>Chop fine the cooked white meat of a piece of
chicken. Season it with salt and pepper, and sprinkle
it over an omelet, or stir it into the egg before cooking,
in the proportion of one teaspoon to an egg, as
is done with ham.</p>

<h4>OMELET WITH TOMATO</h4>

<p>Prepare thin slices of very ripe tomatoes, by removing
the skin and seasoning slightly with salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Lay them on that part of the omelet which is to be
the lower half, and fold; or the tomato may be
tucked into the omelet after folding.</p>

<h4>OMELET WITH PARSLEY</h4>

<p>Wash some parsley. Break off the stems and roll
the rest into a little ball; then, holding it firmly in the
left hand, cut slices from it, or chop it on a board.
Stir it into the omelet mixture before it is cooked, in
the proportion of one teaspoon for each egg.</p>

<h4>SPANISH OMELET</h4>

<p>To an omelet mixture add two drops of onion-juice
for each egg, or half a teaspoon of very finely minced
onion.</p>

<h4>ORANGE OMELET</h4>

<p>"The thinly grated rind of one orange and three
tablespoons of the juice, three eggs, and three teaspoons
of powdered sugar. Beat the yolks, add the
sugar, rind, and juice, fold in the beaten whites, and
cook. Fold, turn out, sprinkle thickly with powdered
sugar, and score in diagonal lines with a clean red-hot
poker. The burnt sugar gives to the omelet a
delicious flavor.</p>

<p>"This is a convenient dessert for an emergency, and
may be prepared in ten minutes if one has the oranges."
(From Mrs. D. A. Lincoln's "Boston Cook Book.")</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">POTATOES</h3>

<p>Next to wheat flour, potatoes are our most common
form of starch food. The potato is a tuber, a native
of America, and may be said to have been discovered
to the civilized world by the Spaniards, who found it
growing in Chili and Peru. Thence it was carried to
Spain, and from there to other parts of Europe, some
time in the sixteenth century. Potatoes were at first
used as luxuries, but are now almost ranked among
the necessities of life.</p>

<p>The composition of potatoes (Letherby) is as follows:</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Water</td><td class="tdr">75.00%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Starch</td><td class="tdr">18.80%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Nitrogenous matter</td><td class="tdr">2.00%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Sugar</td><td class="tdr">3.00%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Fat</td><td class="tdr">.20%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Salts</td><td class="tdr">1.00%</td>
    <td class="tdl wd5"><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>From this we see that starch is the principal nutrient,
therefore potatoes in use for food should be associated
with nitrogenous substances, such as eggs, meat,
fish, and milk. The potash salts which potatoes contain
are very valuable. According to Letherby, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
average of thirty-one analyses of the ash of potatoes
gave 59.8 per cent. of potash, 19.1 per cent. of phosphoric
acid, the other ingredients being in exceedingly
small proportions. These salts are necessary to a
healthy condition of the blood. Potatoes are a valuable
antiscorbutic.</p>

<p>According to Mattieu Williams, scurvy prevailed
in Norway to a very serious extent until the introduction
of the potato; and Lang, with other good
authorities, testifies that its disappearance is due to
the use of potatoes by a people who formerly were insufficiently
supplied with salts-giving vegetable food.</p>

<p>The salts of the potato are most abundant in or
near the skin, and the decision of the question as to
whether potatoes shall be pared or not before cooking
is somewhat aided by this fact. For persons
who eat but few other fresh vegetables by all means
leave the skins on, but for those who have access to
a good kitchen garden and have plenty of other
vegetables and fruits from which to get their salts,
it makes no important difference whether the skins
are removed.</p>

<p>The potato is eminently a starch food, and this
knowledge indicates the method of treatment in cooking.
Since starch is its principal ingredient (the
amount of nitrogenous matter being very small), if
it is cooked with reference to that alone, it will be
done in the best possible manner.</p>

<p>Starch, in order to be rendered most digestible and
acceptable to the human system, must be subjected to
a high temperature in the presence of some liquid. At
401° Fahr. (see <a href="#Page_33">pages 33</a> and <a href="#Page_34">34</a>) it is converted into
dextrine. This change, if not performed outside the
body, will be done in the ordinary processes of digestion
after the starch is eaten; therefore the nearer we
approach to it in cooking, the more perfectly is the
food prepared which contains it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Usually the first vegetable prescribed by the physician
for a sick person who is beginning to use solids, is
a baked potato. A baked potato, however, may be no
better than a boiled potato unless it is cooked in so
high a temperature that the starch is affected. Boiled
potatoes cannot be subjected to a higher temperature
than 212° Fahr. Baked potatoes may be done in such
a way that they are but little better than boiled&mdash;for
instance, done in a slow oven. On the other hand,
if they are put into a temperature of 380° or 400°
Fahr., or a hot oven, they will be done in such a manner
that the conversion of starch will in a degree take
place, and they will be consequently both palatable
and easily digested.</p>

<p>Potatoes roasted in hot ashes or embers are delicious,
and for the same reason. But it must not be
understood that by cooking potatoes in a high temperature
the starch which they contain is <em>all</em> changed
into dextrine. This does not usually take place except
in slight degree, but by the high temperature it
is better prepared for this change in the processes of
digestion. Probably what does take place is a sort
of hydration of the starch, resulting in the complete
swelling and final bursting of the granules, with possibly
an intermediate change between this and dextrine.
Just at the moment when potatoes are done
they should be immediately taken from the fire and
served at once. The potato is capable of being made
into a variety of dishes, and when properly prepared
has a delicate flavor which is very acceptable to most
people. <em>It is one of the most easily digested forms of
starch-containing food.</em></p>

<h4>BOILED POTATOES</h4>

<p>For boiled potatoes, if they are to be served whole,
select those of the same shape and size. Wash them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
under a stream of water with a vegetable brush. Pare
carefully so as not to waste the potato, and evenly,
that they may look smooth and shapely. Cook them
in a granite-ware kettle or covered saucepan, in
enough salted boiling water to just cover them. If
cold water is used, there is a greater loss of potash salts
by solution, because of the longer time of exposure to
the action of the liquid. The proportion of salt should
be one teaspoon to a quart of water.</p>

<p>Potatoes being already hydrated, it makes no great
difference whether they are put into hot or cold water,
except in the time which will be required to boil them
and the slight loss of salts. For medium-sized potatoes
from thirty to forty minutes will be necessary
after they begin to boil. The moment they feel soft
when pierced with a fork they are done. Take them
at once from the fire, drain off all the water, and dry
them by gently moving the pan back and forth over
the top of the stove for a minute. Serve as quickly
as possible. Unless they are to be eaten at once, it is
better to mash them, and keep them in the oven until
needed.</p>

<h4>MASHED POTATOES</h4>

<p>For mashed potatoes the uneven sizes may be used;
the large ones should be cut into small pieces. Prepare
according to the foregoing rule, and when they
are cooked and dried, add salt, butter, pepper, and
cream, in the following proportions:</p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of potatoes.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of butter.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
½ Saltspoon of pepper (white).<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of sweet cream or of milk.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Put into the potatoes the butter, salt, and pepper,
and mash them on the stove, in the dish in which they
were boiled, to keep them hot. Use an open wire
potato-masher, and mash quickly so that they may be
light and dry, not "gummy." Last put in the cream,
mix for a moment, and serve immediately in a covered
vegetable-dish. If it is necessary to keep them for a
time, arrange them like a cake in the dish in which
they are to be served, smooth over the top, dot it
with little bits of butter, or brush it over with milk
or the beaten white of egg, and brown them a delicate
golden color by placing the dish on the grate in the
oven.</p>

<h4>BAKED POTATOES</h4>

<p>For baked potatoes, select those which are of uniform
size and not very large. Scrub them thoroughly
in a stream of water from the faucet, to wash off every
particle of sand, for many like to eat the outside.
Bake them in a hot oven for from forty-five to fifty
minutes. If the potatoes are of <em>medium</em> size, and do
not cook in that time, it indicates that the oven is not
of the proper temperature.</p>

<p>Baked potatoes, not being exposed to the solvent
action of a liquid, lose none of their potash salts in
cooking, as boiled potatoes do. The same is true of
those roasted, and of those fried raw in deep fat.</p>

<h4>ROASTED POTATOES</h4>

<p>Bury medium-sized potatoes in the embers or ashes
of an open fire for a half hour or more, according to
their size. At the end of that time dust off the ashes
with a brush. Burst the shells by squeezing them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the hand, and serve at once with salt, and butter or
cream. Either baked or roasted potatoes are delicious
eaten with sweet cream, salt, and pepper.</p>

<h4>CREAMED POTATOES</h4>

<p>Left-over potatoes may be used for this dish, or
potatoes may be boiled on purpose for it. Whichever
is used, cut them into half-inch dice, put them in an
omelet-pan, season them with salt and pepper, and
pour in milk until it is even with the surface of the
potato; then simmer gently until all the milk is absorbed,
or for about half an hour. For every pint of
potatoes make a pint of white sauce, season it with
a saltspoon of salt and a teaspoon of chopped parsley,
and pour it over. Potatoes are very nice done
in this way, if care is taken in simmering them in the
milk. Unless this is done according to the rule, they
will have the cold-potato taste, which is not at all
palatable.</p>

<p>A little chopped onion may replace the parsley with
good effect.</p>

<h4>DUCHESS POTATOES</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of potatoes.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of butter.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Egg.<br />
¼ Teaspoon of white pepper.<br />
</div>

<p>Wash, pare, and boil the potatoes. Drain out every
drop of water, and dry them in the usual way. When
dry and mealy, put in the butter, salt, and pepper, and
mash them thoroughly and quickly. If potatoes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
mashed for a long time slowly, they become waxy,
so endeavor to do it quickly and as lightly as possible.
Then add the egg, well beaten, and the cream; mix,
and form it into a flat cake (on a board) about half an
inch thick. Cut it into oblongs or squares, or shape
it into rounds or balls, brush over with the beaten
white of egg, or milk, and bake in a hot oven until
a delicate brown. Serve the cakes on a platter as
soon as they are done.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">MEATS</h3>

<p class="pfs90">(BROILED)</p>

<p>Of the different ways of cooking the flesh of animals,
especially for the sick, broiling is at once the
most delicious and the most difficult.</p>

<p>The difference between broiled meat and meat
cooked in water is that the broiled meat is cooked in
its own juices, while the other is not. The albumen
is coagulated in both cases, and the gelatinous and
fibrinous tissues are softened by being heated in a
liquid. In broiling or roasting meat the juices are
retained, while in stewing they go more or less into
the water, and the loosening of the fibers and solution
of the gelatin and fibrin may be carried further,
on account of the longer exposure to heat and the
larger amount of solvent. In broiling, as the meat is
to be cooked in its own juices, it is evident that these
must be retained as completely as possible; and in
order to succeed in this, we have to struggle with a
dry heat, which may not only cause rapid evaporation,
but may volatilize or decompose some of the flavoring
principles.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>We should, therefore, endeavor to have such a temperature
as shall at first be sufficiently high to quickly
coagulate, even harden, the albumen in the outside
surface, and thus form a layer or protecting coat over
the whole, and then to so modify and regulate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
heat afterward that the interior shall be raised to
such a temperature as shall properly cook it without
loss of its nutritive properties.</p>

<p>The time of exposure will be different for different
kinds of meat&mdash;beef and mutton requiring a shorter
time than lamb, chicken, or game. Beef and mutton
are best when cooked rare; lamb, chicken, and some
kinds of game are best when well done. Game with
<em>white flesh</em> should be <em>well done</em>; <em>all other kinds</em>, generally
speaking, may be <em>rare</em>.</p>

<p>Much of the science of cooking depends upon a
knowledge of the effects of heat; and as many changes
in food are due to the dissociation caused by heat, the
degree of change depending upon the temperature,
the value of a sound knowledge of the subject cannot
fail to be seen.</p>

<p>To illustrate: aside from the evaporation of juices
and coagulation of albumen in a piece of steak, the
chemical separation of its constituents, especially of
the outside shell or sheath, will vary with the degree
of heat in which it is cooked.</p>

<p>Not only for meats, but for most animal foods, a
cooking temperature less than 212° but above 160° is
most advisable. This applies particularly to milk,
eggs, oysters, meats, and fish. Of course in broiling
we partially sacrifice the outside by cooking in a
high temperature for the sake of preserving the inner
portions.</p>

<h4>BEEF</h4>

<p>Beef is, without doubt, our most valuable kind of
meat. It is nutritious, of excellent flavor, and comparatively
easy of digestion. It contains many of the
substances necessary to nourish the body&mdash;water, fat,
albumen, gelatin, fibrin, salts, and flavoring properties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
The direct nutrients which it contains are fat
and protein.</p>

<p>The quality of beef varies with the age of the animal
and the manner in which it has been fattened.
It requires a considerable amount of study to be
able to select a good roast or steak. If the fat be
of light, golden color, firm and thick, and the lean
be streaked with fine lines of fat, it is one indication
of a well-nourished animal. A reliable dealer may
be of great service in aiding one to distinguish between
good and poor qualities.</p>

<p>The best portions for steak are from the loin, top
of the round, and rump. The cut called "porterhouse"
is from near the middle of the loin, and is
the best portion of the animal. It has a rich, fine
flavor, and contains a section of tenderloin. Sirloin
steak is from the loin, and is also very nice. The
first and second cuts from the top of the round are
excellent, containing much well-flavored juice. The
composition of a round steak free from bones is as
follows (in 100 parts):</p>

<p><b>To Broil Steak.</b> Select a steak from the loin, top of
the round, or rump. Have it cut an inch and a half
(or, better, two inches) thick. If there is a great deal
of fat, trim off part of it, and wipe the steak with a
clean, wet cloth. A fire of glowing red coals is necessary
to do broiling well. Place the steak in a wire
broiler, and put it as near the coals as possible (one
writer says plunge it into the hottest part of the fire),
<em>count ten</em> and turn it, count again and turn again until
it has been turned <em>five</em> or <em>six times</em> so as to quickly cook
a thin layer all over the outside, to shut in the juices
of the meat, and to form a protecting sheath of
coagulated albumen over the whole. Then lift the
broiler away from the coals and do the rest of the
process <em>slowly</em>,&mdash;that is, in a lower temperature, that
the heat may have time to penetrate to the center of
the piece and raise the juices to a sufficiently high
temperature to soften the fibers, but not so high as
to hornify the albumen or char the outside. Turn it
every half minute until done.</p>

<p>If the fat melts and flames, do not lift up the broiler;
it will do no harm, and the black deposit which results
is only carbon. This carbon is not injurious; the color
is not especially attractive, but the taste will be good.
The cautious cook who does not appreciate this will lift
up the broiler, thus cooling the meat, and will perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
blow out the flame, a proceeding which is open to
question as a point of neatness.</p>

<p>As coal fires are never twice alike, and the amount
of heat sent out is variable, it is constantly necessary
to judge anew as to where the broiler shall be placed.
A certain amount of practice is required to be able
to broil with even fair success. When done a steak
should be brown on the outside, pink and juicy inside,
and plump, not shriveled. Steak should be at least an
inch thick, otherwise the proportion of surface exposed
to the heat will be so great in proportion to
the amount of meat as to cause the loss by evaporation
of most of the juice, thus making the steak
tough and dry.</p>

<p>From <em>five</em> to <em>seven</em> minutes will be required to cook
a steak an inch thick; if an inch and a half thick,
from <em>eight</em> to <em>ten</em> minutes. Serve the steak on a hot
platter after having seasoned <em>both</em> sides of it with salt
and pepper, but no butter. If it is desirable to use
butter, serve it with the steak rather than on it.</p>

<h5>HAMBURG STEAK. No. 1</h5>

<p class="pfs90">(SCRAPED BEEF)</p>

<p>Cut a piece of tender steak half an inch thick. Lay
it on a meat-board, and with a sharp knife scrape off
the soft part until there is nothing left but the tough,
stringy fibers. Season this pulp with salt and pepper,
make it into little flat, round cakes half an inch
thick, and broil them two minutes. Serve on rounds
of buttered toast. This is a safe and dainty way to
prepare steak for one who is just beginning to eat
meat. When it is not convenient to have glowing
coals, these meat-cakes may be broiled in a very hot
omelet-pan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h5>HAMBURG STEAK. No. 2</h5>

<p>Pound a thin piece of beefsteak until the fibers are
broken; season it with salt and pepper, fold and
pound again; then broil it three or four minutes over
a clear hot fire. Serve at once.</p>

<h5>TENDERLOIN STEAK</h5>

<p>Broil a tenderloin steak, and at the same time a
small piece of round steak, which usually contains
a great deal of well-flavored juice. Cut the round
steak into small pieces, and squeeze the juice from it
over the tenderloin. Tenderloin steak is tender, but
usually neither juicy nor particularly well flavored.
By this method one gets a delicious steak.</p>

<h5>BEEFSTEAK <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À LA MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL</span></h5>

<p>Broil a steak, place it on a platter, and season it with
salt and pepper; sprinkle it with finely chopped parsley,
drops of lemon-juice, and some little bits of
butter. Set it in the oven long enough to soften the
butter. A steak done in this way may be made quite
attractive by garnishing it with hot mashed and seasoned
potatoes which have been squeezed through a
potato-strainer. A colander may be used in lieu of a
strainer. The potato loses some of its heat in the
process, so care must be taken to have the dish very
hot or to place it in the oven until it becomes so.</p>

<p>A steak may always be garnished with parsley,
water-cress, or slices of lemon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHICKEN</h4>

<p class="pfs90">(BROILED)</p>

<p>For broiling, select a young chicken&mdash;one from
three to eight months old. Singe it. Split it down
the back, and free it from all refuse, such as pin-feathers,
lungs, kidneys, oil-bag, windpipe, and crop
(the latter is sometimes left in when the chicken is
drawn). Wash it quickly in cold water, fold it in a
clean cloth kept for the purpose, and clap gently
between the hands until all the water is absorbed.
Separate the joints&mdash;the <em>lower joint of the leg</em> and the
<em>upper joint of the wing</em>&mdash;by cutting the flesh on the
under side and severing the white tough tendons.
Soften some butter until it runs, then dip the chicken
into it, season it with salt and pepper, dredge with
flour, and broil it in a wire broiler for from fifteen to
twenty minutes, according to the size.</p>

<p>The same principle holds in broiling chicken as in
steak. The first part of the process should be done
in a high temperature to coagulate the juices of the
outer layers, and the last part very slowly. Care
must be taken that it is thoroughly done at the thick
joints of the wing and leg. Serve hot.</p>

<p><b>To Buy a Chicken.</b> The best chickens have yellow
skin, but one may be deceived if guided by this alone,
for <em>fowls</em> often have yellow skin also. The flexibility
of the end of the breast-bone is always a sure means
of deciding as to the age of the bird. If it be soft,
easily bent, and if it feels like cartilage, the chicken
is young. Sometimes dealers break the bone for the
purpose of deceiving buyers, but it does not take a
great deal of intelligence to decide between a broken
bone and one that is easily bent. If the bone be hard
and firm, it is an indication of age. For broiling, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
course, the chicken should be young, the flesh of good
color and well nourished, and, as in the buying of
beef, one may rely upon the judgment of a good
dealer. The way in which chickens are fed has much
to do with the flavor of the meat.</p>

<h4>BIRDS</h4>

<p>Various kinds of birds, such as squab, partridge,
plover, snipe, pheasant, etc., are particularly appropriate
food for the sick, partly because we associate
them with the dainty things of life, but more on
account of the valuable nutrient properties which
they contain. They are especially rich in salts (particularly
the phosphates), which are so much needed
by a system exhausted by disease.</p>

<p>Birds which feed mostly on grains, such as the
partridge and the pheasant, will bear transportation,
and will keep, in cold weather, a long time. Birds
with dark flesh, which live mostly on animal food,
decay quickly.</p>

<p>A general rule for the cooking of game is this: that
with white flesh should be well done, that with dark
should be rare, and usually is only properly cooked when
served so, as in the case of woodcock, duck, and snipe.</p>

<p><b>When in Season.</b> Some birds, such as reed-birds,
partridge, and plover, have a season which varies
slightly in different parts of the country, according to
the game laws of different States. In Maryland, the
following birds may be found in market according to
the time stated:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The cleansing and preparation of birds is in general
carried out in the same manner as with chickens.
When there is any variation from this, it will be mentioned
under the rule for each.</p>

<h5>SQUABS</h5>

<p>Squabs are young domestic pigeons. The Philadelphia
market supplies nearly all of those used in the
eastern part of the United States.</p>

<p>Remove the feathers, and all pin-feathers; cut off
the head and legs, and split the bird down the back
carefully with a sharp knife. Lift out carefully the
contents of the body, which are contained in a little
sac or delicate membrane; they should be taken out
without breaking. Do not forget the windpipe, crop,
lungs, and kidneys. Wash, and prepare the squab in
the same manner that chicken is done, except the dipping
in butter and dredging with flour; this may
be omitted, as squabs are generally fat and do not
require it. Broil from twelve to fifteen minutes,
according to the size of the bird and the intensity of
the fire. It should be well done. Serve on hot buttered
toast.</p>

<h5>PARTRIDGE</h5>

<p>The partridge is a white-fleshed bird. It may be
broiled or roasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><b>To Broil.</b> Follow the same rule as that given for
squab, except dip in melted butter and dredge with
flour.</p>

<p><b>To Roast.</b> Prepare in the same manner as for broiling,
except dip in butter and dredge twice. Do not
forget the salt and pepper. Then skewer the body so
that it will resemble a whole bird, and look as if it
had not been split down the back. Spread a teaspoon
of butter on the breast, and bake it in a hot oven for
twenty to thirty minutes. Partridge done in this
way is delicious, for the butter enriches the meat,
which is naturally dry. It should be served well
done, not rare, on hot buttered toast, with currant
jelly.</p>

<p>The season for partridges is in most States during
the last part of the autumn, and generally the laws in
regard to them are rigid. Nevertheless, they can be
bought from the middle of October until May, or the
beginning of warm weather. The partridge is a bird
that keeps well, bears transportation, and is sent from
one part of the country to another, many coming from
the West when the season is over in the Eastern
States. It is a medium-sized bird, with mottled brown
feathers, which are black at the ends, especially those
on the back, and mottled brown and silver-gray on
the breast.</p>

<h5>SNIPE</h5>

<p>Snipe may be both prepared and cooked as partridges
are&mdash;that is, broiled and roasted. The snipe
has rich, dark meat, and therefore will not need to be
dipped in butter for either broiling or roasting. It
is about the same size as a squab, but as it is to be
cooked rare (it is more tender and of nicer flavor so),
ten minutes is sufficient time for broiling, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
twelve to fifteen minutes for roasting in a hot oven.
Serve it with currant jelly on hot buttered toast.</p>

<p>The snipe has a long bill, from two to two and a
half inches in length. It is about the size of a squab,
with dark, almost black, wing-feathers tipped with
white, and the feathers of the back are intermingled
with flecks of golden brown. The under sides of the
wings are pearl-gray, and the breast is white.</p>

<h5>PHEASANTS</h5>

<p>Pheasants may be broiled or roasted. As the meat
is dry, they should be well rubbed with soft butter
and dredged with flour. It is a good way, after putting
on the salt and pepper, to dip the bird into
melted butter, then dredge it with flour, then lay on
soft butter and dredge a second time; or, when it is
skewered and ready for the oven, it may be spread
thickly over the breast with softened butter. Care
must be taken that the very thick portion of the
breast be cooked through, as pheasant should be well
done, and from one half to three quarters of an hour
will be necessary for this.</p>

<h5>WOODCOCK</h5>

<p>The woodcock is about the size of a partridge, with
mottled dark brown and gray feathers, except on the
breast, where they are a sort of light salmon brown. It
has a long slender beak, somewhat like that of a
snipe.</p>

<p>Prepare woodcock like squab, only do not cut off
the head, as the brain is considered a dainty by epicures.
Remove the skin from the head, and tie or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
skewer it back against the body. Use salt and pepper
for seasoning, but neither flour nor butter, as the
woodcock has dark, rich flesh. Broil from eight to
ten minutes. Serve rare on toast.</p>

<h5>REED-BIRDS</h5>

<p>Reed-birds are to be prepared after the general
rule for dressing birds. Although they are sometimes
cooked whole, it is better to draw them. Split
them down the back, remove the contents of the body,
and after washing and wiping them, string three or
four on a skewer, pulling it through their sides, so
that they shall appear whole. Roast in a shallow pan
in a hot oven, from <em>eight</em> to <em>ten</em> minutes; or, before
roasting, wrap each one in a very thin slice of fat
pork and pin it on with a skewer (wire).</p>

<p><b>Broiled.</b> Prepare as for roasting, except peel off
the skin, taking the feathers with it. Broil from two
to four minutes. Serve on toast.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to skin all small birds.</p>

<p>The reed-bird is the bobolink of New England, the
reed-bird of Pennsylvania, and the rice-bird of the
Carolinas.</p>

<h5>GROUSE</h5>

<p>The grouse or prairie-hen is in season all the year,
but is at its best during the fall and winter.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare.</b> Clean, wash, and wipe it. Lard the
breast, or fasten to it with slender skewers a thin
slice of salt pork. Grouse has dry flesh, consequently
it will be improved by rubbing softened butter over
it, as well as by using pork. Sprinkle on a little salt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
dredge it with flour, and cook in a quick oven for
thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Grouse are also very nice potted. After they are
made ready for cooking, fry a little fat pork and some
chopped onion together in a large deep spider for a
few minutes, then lay in the grouse, cover the spider,
and fry until the outside of each bird is somewhat
browned, or for twenty minutes, slowly. Then put
them into a granite-ware kettle and stew until tender,
which will take from one to two hours. When they
are done, lift them out, thicken the liquid slightly
with flour, and season it with salt and pepper for a
gravy. Serve the grouse on a deep platter with the
gravy poured around, or simply season the liquid
and cook tiny dumplings in it, which may be served
around the birds. Then thicken the liquid and pour
over. The amount of onion to be fried with the pork
should not exceed half a teaspoon for each bird, and
of pork the proportion of a cubic inch to a bird is
enough.</p>

<p><em>Pigeons</em> potted according to these directions for
grouse are excellent.</p>

<h5>FIELD-LARKS</h5>

<p>Field-larks and robins may be prepared and cooked
in exactly the same way that reed-birds are done.
Robins are good in autumn.</p>

<h4>VENISON</h4>

<p>Venison is in season during the late autumn and
winter. When "hung" for a proper length of time,
it is the most easily digested of all meats. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
reason it is a favorite with epicures who eat late suppers.
According to Dr. Beaumont it is digested in
<em>one hour and thirty-five minutes</em>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Steaks may be taken either from the loin or the
round. Broil them according to the rule for beefsteak,
and serve very hot with a slice of lemon or a little
claret poured over.</p>

<p>Venison will not please an epicure unless it is hot
and rare when served. To accomplish this in a perfectly
satisfactory manner, it has become the fashion
in families to have the broiling done on the table, in
a chafing-dish, each person attending to his own steak,
and cooking it according to his particular fancy.</p>

<h4>MUTTON</h4>

<p>A good piece of meat freed from refuse,&mdash;that is,
indigestible portions such as bone, etc.,&mdash;if neatly prepared
and <em>properly cooked</em>, is practically entirely digested.
If carelessly handled and cooked so that its
juices are evaporated, and its natural flavors undeveloped
or destroyed, there will be more or less waste
in the process of digestion.</p>

<p>Mutton requires more care in cooking than beef,
or, in other words, it is more easily spoiled in that
process; but when done with due consideration, it is
a most acceptable meat. A thick, carefully broiled,
hot, juicy mutton chop just from the coals is a very
delicious morsel. The same piece with the adjectives
reversed,&mdash;that is, done without thought, perhaps
raw in the middle, charred on the outside, and
cold,&mdash;is far from being acceptable to even a healthy
person.</p>

<p>Just inside of the outer skin of the sheep there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a thick, tough membrane enveloping the whole animal;
the peculiar flavor called "woolly," which makes
mutton disagreeable to many, is given to the meat
largely by this covering. It is supposed that the oil
from the wool strikes through. An important point
in the preparation of the meat for cooking is the removal
of this skin, for otherwise the unpleasant taste
will be very strong, and the chop or roast consequently
far from as delicate as it might be.</p>

<p>The value of mutton as a nutrient is practically the
same as that of beef, as may be seen by comparing the
following table with that of beef previously given.</p>

<h5>MUTTON CHOPS</h5>

<p>For the same reason that is given in the rule for
beefsteak, mutton chops should be thick. When the
fat is abundant and little lines of fat run through the
flesh, it is an indication of a good quality of meat.</p>

<p>To prepare the chops for broiling, cut away the
tough outside skin, trim off a part of the fat, but not
all, and any portion of the spinal cord which may be
attached. Broil in the same manner that steak is
done&mdash;that is, close to the glowing coals&mdash;for about
one minute, turning often, and at a distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
them for the rest of the time, which should be from
<em>four</em> to <em>six</em> minutes for a chop an <em>inch thick</em>.</p>

<p>Mutton, like beef, should be served rare. Season
chops with salt and pepper, but no butter, as the meat
is rich in fat and does not require it. Tomato-sauce
is an old-fashioned accompaniment of a chop, and may
or may not be served with it. For breakfast it is better
omitted.</p>

<h5>CHOPS, PAN-BROILED</h5>

<p>Chops are fairly good pan-broiled. The same principle
is to be followed as in cooking over coals&mdash;that
is, a high degree of heat at first, to sear over the outside
before the juices escape, and a low temperature
afterward; therefore heat the pan or spider <em>exceedingly</em>
hot (use no fat), drop in the chop, count ten and
turn, count again and turn again for about one minute,
then draw the pan to the side or back of the
stove and finish slowly. A chop one inch thick will
be perfectly done in from <em>five</em> to <em>seven</em> minutes. If
the pan is hot enough at first, there will be no loss of
juice or flavor. Season and serve in the same manner
as broiled chops.</p>

<h5>FRENCH CHOPS</h5>

<p>Trim a chop until there is nothing left but the
round muscle at the thick end, with a little fat about
it. Cut away all the meat from the bone, which will
then look like a handle with a neat morsel at one
end. Broil.</p>

<h5>CHOPS IN PAPER</h5>

<p>Spread a piece of paper evenly and thickly with
butter. Lay upon it a nicely trimmed chop, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
double the paper with the edges together. Fold and
crease these edges on the three sides; then fold and
crease again, so that the butter cannot run out. These
folds should be <em>half an inch</em> wide. It will be necessary
to have the sheet of paper (note-paper or thick
brown paper will do) considerably more than twice as
large as the chop. Broil over coals, not too near,
turning often so that the temperature shall not get so
high as to ignite the paper. A chop broiled in this
way is basted in the butter and its own juices, and is
very delicate. Be careful not to let the paper ignite,
and yet do not have it so far from the coals that the
meat will not cook. This is best accomplished by
holding the broiler near the coals and turning often:
that is, about once in twenty seconds. There is no
danger that the paper will catch fire if the broiler is
turned often enough. A chop three quarters of an
inch thick will cook in <em>five</em> minutes, one an inch thick
in <em>eight</em>. Should the paper catch fire, it need not destroy
the chop. Take it out, put it into a fresh paper,
and try again. The chop should be served very hot,
seasoned with salt and pepper.</p>

<h4>LAMB CHOPS</h4>

<p>Lamb chops are very delicate and tender. They
may be known by the lighter color of the flesh as
compared with mutton chops, and by the whiteness of
the fat. Prepare and broil them in the same way
that mutton chops are broiled, except that they are
to be <em>well done</em> instead of rare, and to accomplish
this longer cooking by about three minutes will be
required: for a chop an inch thick, from <em>eight</em> to <em>ten</em>
minutes, instead of from four to six as for mutton.</p>

&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of chopped onion.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of white turnip.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of curry-powder.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;A little white pepper.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of rice.<br />
</div>

<p>Left-over broiled chicken or the cuttings from a
cold roast will do for this dish. Divide the meat into
small pieces, excluding all skin, gristle, tendons, and
bone. Boil the bones and scraps, in water enough to
cover them, for an hour. Then strain the liquor, skim
off the fat, and put into it the chicken, onion, turnip
(which should be cut in small cubes), curry-powder,
salt, pepper, and rice. Simmer all together for an
hour. Serve. The vegetables and curry flavor the
meat, and a most easily digested and palatable dish
is the result.</p>

<p>Potatoes may be substituted for the rice, and celery-salt,
bay-leaves, or sweet marjoram for the curry. If
herbs be used, tie them in a bag and drop it into the
stew, of course removing it before carrying the dish
to the table.</p>

<p>The above rule will make enough stew for two
persons. By multiplying each item in it, any amount
may be made.</p>

<h4>BEEF STEW</h4>

<p>Use for beef stew either cold beefsteak, the portions
left from a roast, or uncooked meat.</p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of beef cut into small pieces.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of minced onion.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of turnip.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of carrot.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
½ Cup of cut potatoes.<br />
&nbsp;A little black pepper.<br />
</div>

<p>If beefsteak is selected, free it from fat, gristle, and
bone, and cut it into small pieces. Fry the onion,
carrot, and turnip (which should be cut into small
cubes) in a little butter, slowly, until they are brown.
Add them to the meat, cover it with water, and simmer
for one hour. Then skim off the fat, put in the
potatoes (cut in half-inch cubes) and the salt and pepper.
Boil for half an hour more. Serve in a covered
dish with croutons.</p>

<p>The vegetables are fried partly to give the desirable
brown color to the stew, and partly because
their flavor is finer done that way. A beefsteak stew
is a very savory and satisfactory dish. If fresh, uncooked
meat is used, cut it into small pieces and fry
it in a hot buttered pan for a few minutes, to brown
the outside and thus obtain the agreeable flavor that
is developed in all meats by a high temperature.
Simmer two and a half hours before putting in the
potatoes.</p>

<p>When the left-over portions of a roast are used, the
meat should be freed from all gristle, bone, and fat;
these may be boiled separately for additional broth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<h4>MUTTON STEW</h4>

<p>Exactly the same rule may be followed for mutton
stew as for beef. Do not forget to trim the meat
carefully. Use only clear pieces of the lean. If a
roast is used and there are bones, boil them in water
with the scraps for additional broth. Mutton stew is
good made with pearl-barley instead of potatoes, in the
proportion of one teaspoon of grain to a cup of meat;
it should be put in at the beginning of the cooking.
A half teaspoon of chopped parsley is a nice addition,
or a few tablespoons of stewed and strained tomato.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">SWEETBREADS</h3>

<p>Sweetbreads are the pancreatic glands of the calf.
They are good while the animal lives on milk, but
change their nature when it begins to eat grass and
hay, and are then no longer useful for food. The
gland consists of two parts, the long, slender portion
called the "neck" sweetbread, and the round, thick
part known as the "heart" sweetbread. These are
sometimes sold separately, but they should be together.
Among epicures sweetbreads are considered
a dainty, and are certainly a most acceptable form of
food for the sick.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare.</b> As soon as sweetbreads come from
market, they should be cleaned and parboiled. Cut
off any refuse,&mdash;such as pipes, fat, and all bruised
portions,&mdash;and wash them quickly in cold water.
Pour into a saucepan some boiling water, salt it, and
add a little lemon-juice or vinegar (not more than a
teaspoon to a pint of water); boil the sweetbreads
in this for fifteen minutes if they are to be creamed,
broiled, or baked, or again cooked in any way; but
if they are to be served plain with peas, they should
remain on twenty-five or thirty minutes. When
done, drain off the water and set them aside to cool.
Sweetbreads must always be parboiled as soon as
possible after being taken from the animal, as they
decay quickly. Sweetbreads may be made white by
soaking them in cold water for half an hour; the
flavor, however, is said to be injured by so doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h4>CREAMED SWEETBREADS</h4>

<p>Make a <em>cream sauce</em> with a cup of sweet cream, a
tablespoon of flour, and half a tablespoon of butter.
Then cut a sweetbread into half-inch cubes, salt it
slightly, and sprinkle on a little white pepper. Mix
equal quantities of it and the cream sauce together,
put the mixture into individual porcelain patty-dishes
or scallop-dishes, sprinkle the top with buttered
crumbs, and bake on the grate in a hot oven for ten
minutes. This will give sufficient time to finish the
cooking of the parboiled sweetbread without hardening
it.</p>

<p>The sauce may be made quite acceptably with milk,
by using a tablespoon of butter instead of half that
quantity. This is a good way to prepare sweetbreads,
and one particularly desirable for the sick.
They will be tender and delicate if care is taken
not to overcook them in either the boiling or the
baking.</p>

<h4>FRICASSEED SWEETBREADS</h4>

<p>Cut a parboiled sweetbread into half-inch cubes.
Then make a sauce with half a teaspoon of flour,
a teaspoon of butter, three fourths of a cup of strong
chicken broth, and one fourth of a cup of sweet cream.
Heat the broth. Cook the flour in the butter, letting
the two simmer together until brown, then add the
hot broth, a little at a time, stirring constantly, and
last put in the cream. Season the sauce with a bit of
salt, a little black pepper, half a teaspoon of lemon-juice,
and a speck of curry-powder. Roll the cut
sweetbread into it, simmer for five minutes, and
serve on sippets, or on squares of dry toast in a covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
dish. The chicken broth may be made by boiling
the bones and cuttings of a roast, and milk may
be substituted for the cream.</p>

<h4>SWEETBREADS WITH PEAS</h4>

<p>A favorite way of serving sweetbreads is with fresh
peas. They should be boiled in salted water and
arranged in the middle of a platter with the peas
(cooked and seasoned) around them. Serve them
with a cream sauce. Or the peas may be piled in the
middle of a platter, the sweetbreads arranged as a
border, and the sauce poured around the whole. Sweetbreads
larded and baked may also be served in this
way.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">FISH</h3>

<p>Fish fresh from the lakes or sea is excellent food.
The point of freshness is a very important one, for
all kinds spoil quickly, and, unless you can be quite
sure how long they have been out of the water, it is
better to find some other food for your invalid. Some
shell-fish, such as crabs and lobsters, are especially
dangerous, and should not be eaten by either sick or
well, unless they are <em>known</em> to be in perfect condition.
For the sick they had better not be used at all.</p>

<p>"The flesh of good fresh fish is <em>firm</em> and <em>hard</em>, and
will rise at once when pressed with the finger. If
the eyes be dull or sunken, the gills pale, and the
flesh soft and flabby, the fish is not fresh." (Mrs.
Lincoln.)</p>

<p>Fish with red blood, such for instance as <em>salmon</em>,
are highly nutritious but not easily digested, partly
because of the amount of fat distributed through the
flesh. <em>Herring</em> and <em>mackerel</em> belong to this class.
White fish, such as <em>cod</em>, <em>haddock</em>, <em>turbot</em>, <em>halibut</em>, and
<em>flounder</em>, contain comparatively little fat, and that
mostly in the liver. They are easy of digestion, and
possess a delicate flavor. When in season and just
from their native element, these fish are delicious,
and make excellent food for the sick, on account of
the ease with which they are digested.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare.</b> If fish be brought from market with
the scales on, as is usually the case, it is a very easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
matter to remove them. A large sheet of brown
paper, or a newspaper, and a knife not very sharp, are
all that are necessary. Spread the paper on the table,
lay the fish upon it, and then with the blade of the
knife held <em>parallel</em> with the body of the fish, or nearly
so, not at right angles to it, push off the scales.
They will come off easily, and will not fly unless you
turn the edge of the knife too much. Should this
happen, the paper will catch the scales, and when the
fish is finished all the refuse can be rolled up in the
paper and burned. After removing the scales, cut
off the head, fins, and tail. Make a slit on the under
side, and take out the contents of the cavity, clearing
out everything that is not flesh. Then wash the fish
quickly in a stream of cold water, wipe it, and set it
in a cool place (a refrigerator if you have it) until it is
required for cooking. Do not lay it directly on ice,
for the juices of the fish are dissolved by the water
which is formed as the ice melts, and its delicate
flavor is thus impaired.</p>

<h4>BROILED FISH</h4>

<p>Small fish, such as perch, scrod (young cod), etc., are
excellent broiled. After the fish is cleaned, washed
out, and wiped, split it lengthwise if it be thick,
sprinkle on salt and pepper, squeeze over it some
drops of lemon-juice, dip it in melted butter, and
broil over clear coals, quickly at first and then very
slowly, allowing ten minutes for each inch of thickness.
Serve with butter cream.</p>

<p><b>To Make Butter Cream.</b> Cream some butter in a cup
or bowl, season it with salt, Cayenne pepper, lemon-juice,
and vinegar. A teaspoon of butter is enough
for an ordinary small fish such as a perch, and to
season it a speck of cayenne, a speck of salt, and a
teaspoon of vinegar and lemon-juice (half of each),
will be good proportions. Spread it on the fish, and
let it melt and run over it, or serve it separately in
a little ball on a glass butter-plate. A nice addition
to the butter is a little finely minced parsley, or
chopped pickle, such as cucumbers or olives, or the
three mixed, if they are at hand.</p>

<h4>CREAMED FISH</h4>

<p>To make creamed fish, any white fish which flakes
easily may be used. Cusk, cod, and haddock are especially
recommended. Cook the fish fifteen or twenty
minutes by gentle boiling. Then remove the flesh
carefully from the bones, letting it separate into flakes;
season it with pepper and salt, and a few drops of
lemon-juice sprinkled over. For every pint of prepared
fish make a rich cream sauce with four tablespoons
of butter, two of flour, and a pint of milk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
which a small slice of onion has been boiled. Pour
the sauce over the seasoned fish, rolling them together
gently so that the flakes may not be broken, arrange
on a platter, sprinkle the top with buttered crumbs,
and bake in a hot oven from twenty minutes to half
an hour. A speck of cayenne is a good addition to
make to the sauce. This is a delicious and wholesome
dish. The butter is so thoroughly incorporated with
the flour of the sauce that it becomes one of the few
very easily digested forms of cooked fat.</p>

<h4>BOILED FISH</h4>

<p>Select any white fish&mdash;fresh cod for instance. Prepare
it according to the directions given for cleaning
fish, put it into a wire vegetable-basket, drop the
basket into a dish of boiling salted water, and let it
simmer for from fifteen minutes to three quarters of
an hour according to the size of the fish (a cod weighing
three pounds will require cooking a half hour).
Do not allow it to boil rapidly at any time, or it will
break. When it is done lift it out of the basket and
serve it at once with drawn butter made in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Put two tablespoons of butter and one of flour into
a saucepan; let them simmer together for two minutes
(count the time); then add, a little at a time, a pint
of boiling water or of chicken broth, stirring constantly.
This will give a smooth cream-like sauce
which will be enough for two pounds of fish. Season
it with parsley, grated yolks of hard-boiled eggs, a
few drops of lemon-juice, a bit each of cayenne and
mustard, and a few drops of onion-juice.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">CUSTARDS, CREAMS, PUDDINGS, AND
BLANC-MANGE</h3>

<h4>SOFT CUSTARD</h4>

<p class="pfs90">(BOILED)</p>

<p>Soft custard is a nutritious dish made of yolk of
egg and milk. It is frequently used as a sauce for
puddings, but is very good, eaten by itself, for one
who is confined to light or liquid diet.</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Pint of milk.<br />
Yolks of two eggs.<br />
2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the milk into a saucepan, and set it on the stove
to boil. Beat together the yolks of the eggs, the salt,
and the sugar, in a bowl, and when the milk just
reaches the boiling-point, pour it in slowly, stirring
until all is mixed. Return it to the saucepan without
delay, and cook for <em>three minutes</em>, meanwhile stirring
it slowly. Carefully endeavor not to either overcook
or undercook the custard, for if it is not cooked enough,
it will have a raw, unpleasant, "eggy" taste, and if it is
cooked too much, it will have the appearance of being
curdled. If there is no unnecessary delay in pouring
the milk into the egg so that not much of its heat is
lost, and if it is returned immediately to the fire,
three minutes' exposure to the heat will usually be
long enough, but of course the time will vary according
to the condition of the fire and the kind of pan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
used. When done, strain it at once into a cool dish,
and flavor it with a teaspoon of vanilla. Soft custard
may also be flavored with sherry wine, almond extract,
cinnamon-bark, caramel, and nutmeg. It should
be of a smooth and even consistency, and as thick as
rich cream.</p>

<h4>BAKED CUSTARD</h4>

<p class="pfs90">(IN CUPS)</p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of milk.<br />
&nbsp;2 Eggs.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
½ Square inch of cinnamon-bark.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the cinnamon and milk together in a saucepan,
and set on the stove to heat. Break the eggs into a
bowl, add the salt and sugar, and beat them until well
mixed, but not light. When the milk boils, pour it on
the beaten egg, stir slowly for a minute to dissolve
the sugar, and then strain it into custard-cups. Place
the cups in a deep iron baking-pan, and pour <em>boiling</em>
water around, until it reaches almost to their tops.
Bake in a hot oven twenty minutes.</p>

<p>The blue baking-cups which are small at the bottom
and widen toward the top are good ones to use. They
bear the fire well, and are pretty enough to serve.</p>

<p>By baking the custards in a dish of boiling water,
the temperature cannot rise higher than 212° Fahr.,
and there is less danger of hardening the albumen in
the more exposed portions before the middle is cooked
enough, than if water is not used. The top is sacrificed&mdash;somewhat
overcooked&mdash;for the sake of the
pretty brown color which they should always have.
Custards, when done, should be of a perfectly smooth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
even, velvety consistence throughout, not curdled or
wheyey.</p>

<p>To test them after they have been cooking twenty
minutes, dip a pointed knife into water, and plunge
it into the middle of the custard. If it comes out
clean, the custard is done; if milky, it is not cooked
enough, and should be put into the oven for five minutes
longer. Do not try every one unless the cups are
of different sizes, and make a small, narrow slit, so that
their appearance will not be too much injured. This
mixture may also be baked in a pudding-dish. Baked
custards may be flavored with a variety of substances,
among the best of which are grated nutmeg, almond
extract, vanilla, and caramel.</p>

<p><b>To Make Caramel.</b> Boil together one cup of sugar
and one third of a cup of water until the color is a
rich reddish brown, then add one cup of water, and
bottle for use. Two tablespoons of this syrup will be
required to flavor a pint of custard.</p>

<h4>FRENCH CUSTARD</h4>

<p>Make a custard mixture according to the above rule,
omitting the cinnamon. Put into the bottom of the
custard-cups in which it is to be baked, a teaspoon of
raspberry jam. Then with a tunnel pour the custard
in slowly. Bake twenty minutes. The jam, if firm, will
not mix with the custard. It imparts a nice flavor to
the whole, and is an interesting dish to many, who
wonder how the jam can be kept from dissolving.</p>

<h4>RENNET CUSTARD OR SLIP</h4>

<p>Put into a glass pudding-dish a pint of milk, a
tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon of rennet. Stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to dissolve the sugar, cover it and place it on the
stove-hearth, or any warm place, to heat sufficiently
for the rennet to act upon the casein of the milk&mdash;that
is, to about 98° Fahr. As soon as it is "set," or
becomes solid, remove to a cool place, so that the separation
of the casein shall not go too far and whey
appear. When it is cool, serve it in glass dishes. Rennet
custard may be flavored with nutmeg grated over
the surface, or by stirring in with the rennet a teaspoon
of vanilla, or of rose-water, or a tablespoon of
wine. When brandy is added, it is called <em>junket</em>.</p>

<p>Liquid rennet is an extract of the inner lining of
the stomach of the calf. It has the power of freeing
the albuminous part of milk from its solution,&mdash;in
other words, of coagulating it. Rennet custard is not
of course strictly a custard; it is also called slip, and
in Cape Cod it bears the graphic name of "Gap-and-swallow."</p>

<h4>EGG CREAM</h4>

<div class="recipe">
2 Eggs.<br />
2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
Juice and grated rind of half a lemon.<br />
</div>

<p>Separate the yolks of the eggs from the whites, and
beat them with the sugar in a bowl until both are
well mixed. Then put in the lemon-juice and rind,
and place the bowl in a dish of boiling water on
the fire. Stir slowly until the mixture begins to
thicken; then add the beaten whites of the eggs and
stir for two minutes, or until the whole resembles
<em>very thick</em> cream; then remove it from the fire, pour
into a small pudding-dish, and set it away to cool.
Serve in small pretty china cups, or small glass dishes,
for a mid-afternoon lunch or for tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h4>VELVET CREAM</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Box of gelatine.<br />
¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
¼ Cup of sherry wine.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of lemon-juice.<br />
½ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1¼ Cups of creamy milk, or<br />
&nbsp;1½ Cups of sweet cream.<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the cold water in a bowl for
half an hour; then pour in the wine, and set the bowl
in a dish of boiling water on the fire. When the
gelatine is dissolved, put in the lemon-juice and
sugar, stir for a minute to dissolve the sugar, and
then strain it through a fine wire strainer into a granite
or other metal pan. Set the pan in a dish of ice
and water to cool. As soon as it begins to thicken,
or is about the consistency of molasses on a warm
day, turn in the cream and stir regularly and constantly
until it begins to thicken. Before it is quite
as hard as it will become, turn it into a glass or
pretty china dish, in which it may be served, and set
it away in the refrigerator or back in the dish of ice
and water until perfectly firm. Serve it in small glass
or china dishes, with sweet cream poured over. This
cream should be of a perfectly smooth, even consistency,
hence the name "velvet cream."</p>

<h4>COFFEE CREAM</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Box of gelatine.<br />
¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
½ Cup of strong coffee.<br />
½ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Cups of sweet cream, or<br />
&nbsp;1¼ Cups of creamy milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the cold water for half an
hour. Then pour on the coffee, boiling hot, to dissolve
it; add the sugar, stir until it is dissolved, and
strain the liquid into a granite pan. Set it in iced
water to cool; when it has become so, and is beginning
to thicken, or is about the consistency of syrup or
a little thinner, pour in the cream; stir regularly and
evenly for about ten minutes, or until it is thick, but
not hard; then turn it into a glass dish while it is
still slightly soft, and it will settle into a smooth, even
mass. It may be returned to the iced water, or put
into a refrigerator, to stiffen.</p>

<p>Coffee cream is similar to velvet cream and the process
is exactly the same for both. They are delicious
creams, very nutritious, and to be recommended for
their excellent nourishing properties and flavors.</p>

<p><b>To Make the Coffee.</b> Mix two tablespoons of ground
fresh Java, or Java and Mocha coffee mixed, with a
little cold water and raw egg (either white or yolk) in a
coffee-pot. Stir it to thoroughly mix the egg and coffee.
Pour in a cup of boiling water, and set it to boil for
five minutes. Then move the pot to a less hot part
of the stove, where the coffee will barely simmer, for
ten minutes, when it will be ready for use.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE CREAM</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
½ Ounce (½ square) of Baker's chocolate.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of cream.<br />
Whites of four eggs.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Cook the sugar, chocolate, and cream (sweet cream
or, if that cannot be had, rich milk) together in a
double boiler until the chocolate is perfectly dissolved.
It will require occasional stirring, and should
be, when done, entirely free from specks or flakes of
chocolate. Then stir in, pouring slowly, the well-beaten
whites of the eggs while the cream is still on
the stove. Cook for three minutes, or until the albumen
is coagulated, but not hardened. It should look
creamy and smooth, not curdled. Turn into a pudding-dish
and cool.</p>

<h4>TAPIOCA CREAM</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Cup of granulated tapioca.<br />
¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of milk.<br />
&nbsp;3 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;2 Eggs.<br />
</div>

<p>After the tapioca is picked over and washed, put it
into a double boiler with the cold water, and let it
stand until the water is absorbed. Then pour in the
pint of milk, and cook until each grain is transparent
and soft. It will take an hour. At this point, beat
the eggs, sugar, and salt together until very light, and
pour them slowly into the hot pudding, at the same
time stirring rapidly, so that the two will be perfectly
mixed. After the egg is in, continue to stir for about
three minutes, or long enough to cook the egg as it
is done in soft custard. The pudding should have
the appearance of cream, as the name indicates, with
flecks of tapioca all through it. Turn it into a china
dish. Serve either hot or cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h4>RICE CREAM</h4>

<div class="recipe">
2 Tablespoons of rice.<br />
2 Cups of milk.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
2 Eggs.<br />
</div>

<p>Cleanse the rice by washing it several times in cold
water; cook it in a double boiler with the milk until
the grains will mash. Three hours will generally
be required to do this. Should the milk evaporate,
restore the amount lost. When the rice is perfectly
soft, press it through a coarse soup-strainer or colander
into a saucepan, return it to the fire, and
while it is heating beat the eggs, sugar, and salt
together until very light. When the rice boils, pour
the egg in rather slowly, stirring lightly with a spoon
for three or four minutes, or until it coagulates and
the whole is like a thick, soft pudding; then remove
from the fire, and pour it into a pretty dish. By
omitting the yolks and using the whites of the eggs
only, a delicate white cream is obtained.</p>

<h4>PEACH FOAM</h4>

<p class="pfs90">(DELICIOUS)</p>

<p>Peel and cut into small pieces three or four choice
and very ripe peaches (White Heaths are good), so
that when done there will be a cupful. Put them
into a bowl, with half a cup of powdered sugar, and
the white of one egg. Beat with a fork for <em>half an
hour</em>, when it will be a thick, perfectly smooth, velvety
cream, with a delightful peach flavor, and may
be eaten <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i> by an invalid.</p>

<h4>SNOW PUDDING</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Box of gelatine.<br />
¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of sugar.<br />
¼ Cup of lemon-juice.<br />
Whites of three eggs.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a><br />
</div>

<p><em>For the sauce</em>:</p>

<div class="recipe">
Yolks of two eggs.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
½ Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of milk.<br />
½ Teaspoon of vanilla.<br />
</div>

<p>Divide a box of gelatine into fourths by notching one
of the upright edges. Cut off one fourth of the box
for a measure, which can afterward be used as a cover.
When taking out a fourth, be sure to pack the measure
as closely as it was packed in the box. Soak the
gelatine in the cold water for half an hour. Then
pour on the boiling water, add the sugar and lemon-juice,
stir for a minute, and strain through a fine wire
strainer into a granite pan; place the pan in iced water
to cool. Meanwhile beat the eggs as light as possible,
and as soon as the gelatine mixture begins to thicken,
or is about as thick as honey, turn in the eggs, and
stir slowly and regularly, with the back of the bowl of
the spoon against the bottom of the pan, until the egg
is mixed completely with the gelatine and the whole
nearly stiff. Just before it becomes firm turn it into a
melon-mold, and return it to the iced water to harden.
It should be perfectly white, <em>literally</em>, like snow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>With the materials for the sauce make a soft custard,
cool it, and serve with the pudding either in a
pitcher, or poured around it in an ice-cream dish, or
other shallow pudding-dish.</p>

<h4>PRINCESS PUDDING</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Box of gelatine.<br />
¼ Cup of cold water.<br />
¾ Cup of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of sugar.<br />
½ Cup of white wine (sherry).<br />
Juice of one lemon.<br />
Whites of three eggs.<br />
</div>

<p><em>For the sauce</em>:</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Pint of milk.<br />
Yolks of two eggs.<br />
3 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1 Teaspoon of rose-water.<br />
</div>

<p>The process is exactly the same as for <em>snow pudding</em>,
and it is served in the same manner, with the
soft custard for a sauce. Ordinary sherry wine may
be used, although white sherry is better.</p>

<h4>CORN-STARCH PUDDING</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1½ Tablespoons of corn-starch.<br />
1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
2 Tablespoons of cold water.<br />
1 Pint of milk.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Put the milk on the stove to heat. Mix in a saucepan
the corn-starch, sugar, and salt with the cold
water, and when the milk has just begun to boil pour
it in, slowly at first, stirring all the while. The corn-starch
should become thick at once, when it may be
poured into a clean double boiler and cooked thirty
minutes. The time should be faithfully kept, as corn-starch
is an unpalatable and indigestible substance unless
thoroughly cooked. See to it that the water in the
under boiler <em>actually boils</em> during the thirty minutes.
At the end of that time beat one egg very light, and
stir it in, pouring slowly, so that it may be mixed
all through the hot pudding and puff it up. Then
cook for one minute, turn it into a china pudding-dish,
or into individual molds, and cool. Serve with
cream.</p>

<p>Corn-starch pudding should have a tender consistency
and a sweet and wholesome taste. The difficulty
with many is that they are not thoroughly
cooked, and are too stiff and hard when cool. When
you find this to be the case, lessen the amount of
corn-starch used. The proportion in this recipe may
always be relied upon.</p>

<p>Other similar puddings may be made by substituting
in the above recipe arrowroot, flour, or farina for
the corn-starch.</p>

<h4>BARLEY PUDDING</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of Robinson's barley flour.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of water (boiling).<br />
½ Cup of rich milk.<br />
Whites of three eggs.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a saucepan with a
little cold water. When smooth and free from lumps
pour in the boiling water, slowly stirring meanwhile
to keep it smooth; then set it on the fire to simmer for
ten minutes, continuing the stirring until it is thick.
To prevent burning, draw the pan to the side of the
stove, unless the fire is very slow, for barley is a grain
which sticks and burns easily. At the end of the ten
minutes put in the milk, and strain all into a clean
saucepan, through a coarse strainer, to make the consistency
even. Beat the whites of the eggs until light
but not stiff, and stir, not beat, them into the pudding,
making it thoroughly smooth before returning it to
the fire. Cook for five minutes, stirring and folding
the pudding lightly until the egg is coagulated. Then
pour it into a china pudding-dish. Serve cold with
sweet cream. This is good for one who is just beginning
to eat solid food.</p>

<h4>CREAM-OF-RICE PUDDING</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Quart of milk.<br />
½ Cup of rice.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the milk, rice, sugar, and salt together in a
pudding-dish, stir until the sugar is dissolved, then
place the dish in a pan of water, and bake in a slow
oven for three hours, cutting in the crust which forms
on the top once during the time. Should the pudding
become dry, pour over it a little more milk, but this
will not happen unless the fire is too hot. When
done it ought to be creamy inside, with the grains of
rice almost dissolved in the milk. The long exposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to heat changes both the sugar and the starch, and
gives them an agreeable flavor.</p>

<h4>FRUIT TAPIOCA</h4>

<p>Wash half a cup of tapioca, put it into a double
boiler with a pint of water, and cook until the grains
are soft and transparent. If granulated tapioca is
used, one hour is sufficient time. Then add to it half
a cup of grape or currant jelly, and mix until the
jelly is dissolved; turn it into a pudding-dish. Serve
cold, with sugar and cream. Any well-flavored fruit
jelly may be used instead of the grape or currant.</p>

<h4>TAPIOCA JELLY</h4>

<div class="recipe">
½ Cup of tapioca.<br />
&nbsp;2 Cups of water.<br />
½ Cup of sugar.<br />
Juice and grated rind of half a lemon.<br />
¼ Cup of sherry wine, or<br />
¼ Cup of brandy (French).<br />
</div>

<p>Pick over and wash the tapioca. Put it into a
double boiler with the water, and cook it for one
hour, or until the grains are transparent and soft.
Then add to it the sugar, juice and grated rind of
the lemon, the sherry and the brandy, mixing them
thoroughly. Press all through a wire strainer into
a glass pudding-dish, and set it in a cool place to become
a jelly. It should be served cold, and with
cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<h4>ORANGE LAYERS</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;4 Oranges.<br />
&nbsp;3 Bananas.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of sugar.<br />
⅓ Cup of water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of claret wine.<br />
</div>

<p>Peel the oranges, slice them in thin slices, and remove
the seeds. Peel and slice the bananas. Arrange
both in alternate layers in a glass dish. Make a
syrup of the sugar and water by boiling them together,
without stirring, for ten minutes; then add
the wine, and remove at once from the fire; cool it,
and pour it over the fruit. In half an hour it will be
ready to serve.</p>

<p>It will not do to keep this dish long, as the fruit
shrinks and loses its freshness. One fourth of an
inch is the proper thickness for the slices of orange,
and one sixth or one eighth for the bananas.</p>

<h4>ORANGE BASKETS</h4>

<p>From the end opposite the stem end of an orange cut
out sections in such a way as to form a basket with
a handle.</p>

<p>The body of the basket should be <em>more</em> than <em>half</em> the
orange. With a knife and spoon cut and scrape out
all the pulp from the inside. Fill the baskets with
blocks of orange jelly, or with raspberries, strawberries,
or other fruits. They are pleasing to children,
and are pretty for luncheon or tea. The edges may
be scalloped, and diamonds or rounds cut out of the
sides, if one has time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<h4>IRISH MOSS BLANC-MANGE</h4>

<p>Irish moss, or carrageen, is a sea moss which grows
abundantly along the shores of Europe and America.
After gathering, it is dried and bleached in the sun,
and then packed for market. It is exceedingly rich
in an easily digested vegetable jelly, and is also valuable
for food because of its mineral constituents.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare.</b></p>

<div class="recipe">
⅓ Cup of dry moss.<br />
&nbsp;1 Quart of milk.<br />
¼ Cup of sugar.<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the moss for half an hour in warm water, to
soften it and to loosen the sand which is dried and
entangled in it. Wash each piece separately under a
stream of cold water. Its weight (that of the water)
will carry down the sand. Then put the moss in a
pudding-bag, and cook it in a double boiler in the
quart of milk for one hour. At the end of that time
lift out the bag, squeeze it a little, throw away the
moss, and put the bag to soak in cold water. Add
the sugar to the mixture, strain it into molds, and set
in a cool place to harden. It will form a tender jelly-like
pudding, which has an agreeable taste, resembling
the odor of the sea, which many like. Serve it with
cream, and with or without pink sugar.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>This blanc-mange may also be made without sugar
if it is desirable to have an unsweetened dessert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<h4>PINK BLANC-MANGE</h4>

<p>Make a pudding according to the above rule. Color
it, just before straining, with three or four drops of
carmine, barely enough to give a delicate shell pink,
for if it is very dark it is not attractive.</p>

<p>Carmine for use in cooking is made by mixing one
ounce of No. 40 carmine (which may be obtained of a
druggist) with three ounces of boiling water and one
ounce of ammonia. It should be bottled, and will keep
indefinitely. It is useful for coloring ice-cream, cake,
and puddings.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">SALADS</h3>

<p>Salads are of two classes: the plain salads, consisting
of green herbs or vegetables, such as lettuce,
endive, water-cress, cucumber, etc., dressed or seasoned
with salt, pepper, oil and vinegar, or oil and lemon-juice;
and the so-called meat salads, which consist of
one or more green vegetables, with an admixture of
fish, lobster, crab, fowl, or game. A salad of whichever
kind should be cool, delicate, and prepared by a
gentle hand. Ordinary servants do not enough appreciate
the "niceties" to make acceptable salads.
The lettuce, cress, or whatever green is used, should
be thoroughly washed, but not crushed, broken, or
roughly handled, drained in a wire basket, dried in
a napkin, and then torn with the fingers, <em>not cut</em>. Of
course, cucumbers, beet-root, olives, etc., are exceptions.</p>

<p>The dressing for salads, whether simply oil and vinegar,
or a mayonnaise, should be mixed with a wooden
spoon, and an intelligent mind. As for the seasonings,
the Spanish maxim which reads as follows is a
good guide: "Be a miser with vinegar, a counselor
with salt, and a spendthrift with oil." Let the oil be
of the first quality of genuine olive-oil. In nearly all
the large cities one may get fine oil by searching for
it. Once found, there is no longer any difficulty, so
long as the brand does not deteriorate.</p>

<p>To vary and flavor the salads of vegetables <em>only</em>, use
the fine herbs when in season, for instance balm, mint,
parsley, cress, and sorrel, chopped or minced, and
scattered through the salad. Unless the vinegar is
known to be pure cider or wine vinegar, use lemon-juice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Theodore Child says: "Lemon-juice is the
most delicate and deliciously perfumed acid that nature
has given the cook."</p>

<h4>FRENCH DRESSING</h4>

<p>French dressing is a mixture of fine olive-oil, vinegar
or lemon-juice, or both, salt, Cayenne pepper, and
onion-juice. The following proportions will make
enough for one head of lettuce:</p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of oil.<br />
A bit of cayenne.<br />
½ Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;4 Drops of onion-juice.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of lemon-juice.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of vinegar.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix all together well. This dressing may be used
with lettuce, tomatoes, cold meat, potato salad, and
to marinate chicken, lobster, and crab when they are
to be used for salads.</p>

<h4>MAYONNAISE DRESSING</h4>

<div class="recipe">
½ Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;2 Saltspoons of mustard.<br />
&nbsp;2 Saltspoons of sugar.<br />
¼ Saltspoon of cayenne.<br />
Yolk of one egg.<br />
½ Cup of olive-oil.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of lemon-juice.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of vinegar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of thick sweet cream.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>These proportions may be multiplied or divided to
make larger or smaller quantities. Put the first five
ingredients together in a bowl, and mix them well;
then add the oil one drop at a time, stirring constantly
with a wooden paddle or spoon "round and
round," not back and forth. After dropping and
stirring for ten minutes, the mixture will become stiff
and difficult to turn. At this point stir in a little of
the vinegar or lemon-juice. Then drop in more oil,
and stir until it again becomes stiff. Continue putting
in oil and the acids until all are used, when you
should have a thick, smooth cream which, when taken
up on the end of the spoon, will keep its shape and
not "run." It will take from twenty minutes to half
an hour to make it. Last stir in the cream.</p>

<p>Should the dressing "break," or appear as if curdled,
it may sometimes be restored to smoothness by beating
with a Dover egg-beater, or by adding more egg and
stirring for a while without adding oil. If these expedients
fail, begin all over again, adding the spoiled
dressing to a new one. However, a mayonnaise
dressing will not go wrong except in the hands of a
careless worker. The only points to be observed are
to put the oil in <em>slowly</em>, and to stir <em>constantly</em> and
<em>rapidly</em>. The sweet cream is a valuable addition, giving
the mayonnaise a delicate, satisfying flavor.</p>

<h4>LETTUCE SALAD</h4>

<p>Prepare a head of lettuce by washing each leaf separately
in a stream of water, tearing off any portion
that is bruised or brown, and looking carefully for
little green creatures that may be lodged in the
creases; they are not easily seen. Then drain the
lettuce on a fresh towel or napkin, for if the leaves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
very wet the dressing will not cling to them. Next
tear it to pieces with the fingers, rejecting the large
part of the midrib, put it into a deep bowl, pour
on a French dressing, and toss it with a wooden salad-spoon
and fork until all the lettuce seems oiled.
Serve immediately.</p>

<p>Mayonnaise dressing may be used instead of the
French dressing in this salad.</p>

<h4>TOMATO SALAD</h4>

<p>Wash in cold water and wipe some fair, ripe tomatoes.
Cut them in slices one third of an inch thick.
Do not peel them. Arrange some clean white lettuce
leaves on a silver or china platter, with two large
leaves at either end, their stems toward the middle,
and two small ones at the sides. Lay on them the
slices of tomato, with their edges overlapping each
other. Serve with this salad French dressing.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN SALAD</h4>

<p>Prepare a nice chicken (one not too young) by boiling
it until tender. Then set it away in its own
broth to cool. (It is a good plan to boil the chicken the
day before it is intended for use.) Meanwhile make
a mayonnaise dressing. When the chicken has become
cold, take it from the broth, and cut it as nearly
as possible into half-inch cubes, rejecting all skin,
tendons, cords, and bones. Season it with salt and
pepper. Tear into small pieces with the fingers some
tender, well-cleaned lettuce, and then mix equal quantities
of chicken and lettuce with a part of the dressing;
arrange it in a shallow salad-bowl, and spread
the remainder of the mayonnaise over the top. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
yolk of egg hard-boiled and pressed through a wire
strainer with the back of a spoon, so that it falls in
little crinkled pieces all over the top, makes a pretty
garnish. Celery tops, the tiny inside leaves of lettuce,
and parsley may be used singly or together for
a border.</p>

<p>Chicken salad is usually made with celery instead
of lettuce, but the latter is better for an invalid,
although tender, delicate celery may be used. Serve
a very small quantity, for chicken salad is a concentrated
food, and should not be eaten in large
amounts by either the convalescent or the well. The
chicken, lettuce, and dressing may all be prepared
beforehand, but on no account should they be mixed
together until just before serving.</p>

<h4>POTATO SALAD</h4>

<p>For this salad fresh boiled potatoes, red sugar-beets,
and French dressing are needed. The potatoes and
beets should be cooked in salted water purposely for
the salad, and allowed to become just cool. Cold
potatoes left over from the last meal may be used, but
they are not nice. When the potatoes are cool, cut
them into thin slices, season with a little more salt
and a bit of white pepper; cut the beets also in thin
slices, and mix the two in the proportions of one
third beets to two thirds potatoes, with the dressing,
or arrange them in alternate layers in a salad-bowl,
with the dressing poured over each layer as it is made.</p>

<p>A more dainty way, and one which a person of cultivated
taste will appreciate (as it really makes a
perceptible difference in the flavor of the salad), is to
mix the lemon-juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper together
without the oil, and pour it over the different layers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
as they are laid, and then add the oil by itself. The
acids penetrate and season the vegetables, and the oil
is left on the outside of each piece.</p>

<h4>POTATO SALAD WITH OLIVES</h4>

<p>Make a potato salad according to the foregoing
rule, except substitute chopped olives for the beets, in
the proportion of one eighth olives by measure to
seven eighths potato.</p>

<h4>CELERY SALAD</h4>

<p>"One of the finest salads to be eaten, either alone or
with game, especially partridges or wild duck, is a
mixture of celery, beet-root, and corn-salad. Water-cresses
will make a poor substitute when broken into
small tufts.</p>

<p>"The beets are cut into slices one sixteenth of an
inch thick; the celery, which must be young and
tender and thoroughly white, should be cut into
pieces an inch long, and then sliced lengthwise into
two or three pieces. (N. B.&mdash;Select only the tender
inside branches of celery.) This salad will require
plenty of oil, and more acid than a lettuce salad,
because of the sweetness and absorbent nature of
the beet-root. The general seasoning, too, must be
rather high, because the flavors of the celery and the
beet are pronounced." ("Delicate Feasting," by Theodore
Child.)</p>

<p>There are many kinds of salads, but they are all
based upon the principles stated in these rules. Green
herbs or vegetables treated with French or mayonnaise
dressing, either by themselves or with meats,
form the foundations of all salads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">ICE-CREAM, SHERBETS, AND ICES</h3>

<p>For patients suffering with fevers, and for use in
very warm weather, good ice-cream and sherbet are
most acceptable. They should, however, be used with
great care, particularly if the illness be due to disturbance
of digestion, for they lower the temperature
of the stomach and often cause such disorders as lead
to severe illness. Even if this does not happen, they,
in order to be raised to a temperature at which digestion
will take place, absorb heat from the body, and a
person reduced by illness cannot afford to needlessly
part with any form of energy.</p>

<p>Sherbet in its literal sense means a <em>cool drink</em>. It
is of oriental origin, but in this country it has come
to mean a frozen mixture of fruit, or fruit-juice,
water and sugar. There is a distinction made, however,
between water-ice and sherbet. Sherbet has, in
addition to the fruit-juice and water, either sugar-syrup,
white of egg, or gelatine, to give it sufficient
viscousness to entangle and hold air when beaten in a
freezer, so that sherbets (unless colored by the fruit
used) will be white and opaque like snow. Water-ices,
on the contrary, are made without the white of egg,
syrup, or gelatine, do not entangle air, and are translucent
and what might be called "watery." Both
are delicious when made with fresh, ripe fruit, and
both may be enriched by the addition of sweet cream
if desired.</p>

<p><b>Freezers.</b> Of the various kinds of freezers perhaps
the "Improved White Mountain Freezer" is, everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
considered, as good as any. It is strong and
freezes quickly when the salt and ice are properly proportioned.</p>

<p>It is well to study the gearing before attempting
to use a freezer. The different parts should be
taken apart and put together until it is understood
how the machine works. See that the paddles in
the can do not interfere with each other, and that
the crank turns easily. Then put all together again,
fasten down the crank-bar across the top of the can,
and have everything in readiness before packing the
freezer with salt and ice. The object in using the salt
is to get a greater degree of cold than could be obtained
with the ice alone. The affinity of salt for
water is very great&mdash;so great, that it will break down
the structure of ice in its eagerness for it. Heat is
involved in this process of melting, and will be drawn
from surrounding objects, from the can, the bucket,
the cream, and even the ice itself. The more rapid
the union of salt and ice, the more heat is absorbed,
consequently the greater is the degree of cold and the
quicker the mixture to be frozen will become solid.</p>

<p><em>Water</em> is converted into steam by a certain amount
of heat. <em>Ice</em> is transformed into <em>water</em> by the same
agency, and in the case of the ice-cream freezer heat
is drawn from whatever comes in contact with the
ice that is warmer than itself. If the melting of the
ice can be hastened in any way, the abstraction of
heat will be correspondingly greater; hence the use
of salt, which is so eager for water that it takes it
even in the form of ice. Now it will be easily seen
that if the ice is in small pieces, and there is the
proper amount of salt for each piece, union between
the two will be immediate, the amount of heat used
will be very great, consequently the degree of cold
will be great. Cold is only a less degree of heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Ordinary liquid mixtures that contain a large percentage
of water become solid when reduced to a
temperature of 32° Fahr.</p>

<p><b>To Pack an Ice-Cream Freezer.</b> Break a quantity of
ice into small pieces by pounding it in an ice-bag
(a bag made of canvas or very strong cloth) with a
wooden mallet. The ice should be about as fine as
small rock-salt. Put into the bucket, around the tin
can which is to hold the cream, alternate layers of
the pounded ice and salt in the proportions of two
thirds ice to one third salt (a quart cup may be used
for measuring). Should it happen that you have
"coarse-fine" salt, put all the ice into the freezer first,
and then the salt on top of it, as it will quickly work
down to the bottom. When the packing is complete
unfasten the cross-bar and lift off the cover of the
can carefully, so that no salt shall get inside; then
put in the mixture to be frozen, replace the cover,
and fasten the bar. Let it stand till the mixture is
thoroughly chilled, then turn <em>steadily</em> but not <em>very</em>
fast for about ten minutes, or until the turning becomes
difficult; that is an indication that the contents
of the can are freezing. Continue turning for a few
minutes longer, to give the cream a fine and even consistency;
then take out the paddle, drain off the water
through the hole in the side of the bucket, fill in all
about the can with coarse ice, and cover it with a thick
wet cloth or towel. Let it stand for half an hour to
become firm, when it is ready to serve. If it is desirable
to keep the ice-cream for a length of time, it may
be done by packing the freezer closely with ice and
salt, and covering it with wet cloths. Or, the ice-cream
may be taken from the can, packed in molds of
fanciful shapes, sealed at the edges with melted tallow,
and repacked in ice and salt.</p>

<h4>PHILADELPHIA ICE-CREAM</h4>

<p>The so-called Philadelphia ice-cream is pure, sweet
cream, sweetened with sugar, and flavored. For a
small quantity use the following:</p>

<div class="recipe">
¾ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of vanilla.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of brandy.<br />
&nbsp;1 pint of scalded sweet cream.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix and freeze. The whites of two eggs beaten
stiff is a valuable addition to this cream.</p>

<h4>ROYAL ICE-CREAM</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of flour.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Cups of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of milk.<br />
&nbsp;2 Eggs.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of sweet cream.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of vanilla.<br />
½ Teaspoon of almond.<br />
½ Cup of sherry wine, or<br />
¼ Cup of brandy.<br />
</div>

<p>Heat the milk until it boils; meanwhile mix the
flour, sugar, and salt in a little cold water, and when
the milk reaches the boiling-point pour it in; stir it
for a minute over the fire in a saucepan, and then
turn it into a double boiler and cook it for twenty
minutes. At the end of this time beat the eggs very
light, and pour them into the boiling mixture slowly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
stirring it rapidly; continue stirring, after all the
egg is in, for from one to two minutes; then strain
the mixture into a dish and set it aside to cool. Last,
add the cream and flavorings, and freeze. This makes
a rich and delicious cream. It may be colored with
carmine a pretty pink, or with spinach a delicate
green.</p>

<h4>ICE-CREAM WITH AN IMPROVISED FREEZER</h4>

<p>Make the Philadelphia ice-cream mixture, or half
of it, dividing each ingredient exactly. Put it into a
small tin can (the Dutch cocoa-cans are convenient)
with a closely fitting cover. Place it in the middle of
a deep dish, and surround it with alternate layers of
ice and salt, in the same manner as for ordinary
freezing, and cover it closely; then lay wet cloths on
the top and set it in a cool place. It will become solid
in from one to two hours, according to the amount of
mixture to be frozen. It is well to cut in the thick
layer on the sides of the can once or twice during the
freezing. If the cream which you have to use is thick
enough to whip, do so; the result, when frozen, will be
a very dainty dish.</p>

<p>This is a convenient way of making a little ice-cream
for one person.</p>

<h4>FROZEN CUSTARD</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Pint of milk.<br />
1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
1¼ Cups of sugar.<br />
Yolks of three eggs.<br />
1 Pint of milk or cream.<br />
1 Teaspoon of rose-water.<br />
2 Tablespoons of wine or brandy.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Make a soft custard with the first four ingredients,
according to the rule on <a href="#Page_195">page 195</a>. When done, strain
it into a granite-ware pan and let it cool. Then add
the flavoring and the remaining pint of milk or cream,
and freeze.</p>

<h4>LEMON SHERBET WITH GELATINE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of gelatine.<br />
&nbsp;1 Pint of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of sugar<br />
⅓ Cup of lemon-juice.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of brandy.<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the gelatine (Plymouth Rock or Nelson's) in a
little cold water for <em>half an hour</em>. Then pour over
it the boiling water, stirring until the gelatine is dissolved;
add the sugar, lemon-juice, and brandy, and
strain all through a fine wire strainer. Freeze.</p>

<p>Nelson's gelatine and the Plymouth Rock or phosphated
gelatine are the best to use for sherbets and
water-ices, because they have a delicate flavor, and
lack the strong, fishy taste which characterizes some
kinds. The phosphated gelatine should, however, never
be used except when a slight acidity will do no harm.
Avoid it for all dishes made with cream or milk, as
it will curdle them. The directions on the packages
advise neutralizing the acid with soda; but, as there
is no means of determining the amount of acid in a
given quantity, it is not a process that recommends
itself to an intelligent person.</p>

<p>Phosphated gelatine may, however, be used in
sherbets even when milk or cream forms a part of
them, for when it is added to a slightly acid mixture
which has a low temperature, or is partially frozen,
curdling does not take place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h4>LEMON SHERBET WITH SUGAR SYRUP</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of sugar.<br />
⅓ Cup of lemon-juice.<br />
</div>

<p>Boil the water and sugar together without stirring
for twenty minutes. You will thus obtain a thin
sugar syrup, which, however, has enough viscousness
to entangle and hold air when beaten. As soon as it
is cool, add the lemon-juice, strain, and freeze it. This
makes a snow-white sherbet of very delicate flavor.
Lemon sherbet may also be made with water, sugar,
lemon-juice, and the whites of eggs well beaten,
instead of with gelatine or syrup.</p>

<h4>ORANGE SHERBET</h4>

<div class="recipe">
1 Tablespoon of gelatine.<br />
1 Cup of boiling water.<br />
1 Cup of sugar.<br />
1 Cup of orange-juice.<br />
Juice of one lemon.<br />
2 Tablespoons of brandy.<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the gelatine in just enough cold water to
moisten it, for half an hour. Then pour over it the
cup of boiling water, and put in the other ingredients
in the order in which they are written; when the
sugar is dissolved, strain all through a fine wire
strainer, and freeze it.</p>

<p><b>To get Orange-juice.</b> Peel the oranges, cut them in
small pieces, quarters or eighths, put them into a
jelly-bag or napkin, and press out the juice with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
hand. By this means the oil of the rind, which has
a disagreeable flavor, is excluded.</p>

<h4>APRICOT ICE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Quart of apricots.<br />
&nbsp;1 Quart of water.<br />
½ Quart of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;3 Tablespoons of brandy.<br />
</div>

<p>Either fresh or canned apricots may be used for
this ice. If fresh ones are chosen, wash and wipe
them carefully, cut them into small pieces, mash them
with a potato-masher until broken and soft, and add
the water, sugar, and brandy; then freeze. The
treatment is the same if canned fruit be used. This
ice may be made without the brandy, but it is a valuable
addition, especially for the sick.</p>

<p>Peaches, strawberries, raspberries, pineapple, and
in fact any soft, well-flavored fruit may be made into
water-ice by following exactly the above rule, except,
of course, substituting the different kinds of fruits for
the apricots, and possibly varying the sugar. If pineapple
is selected, it should be chopped quite fine, and
quickly, so that the knife will not discolor it. Peaches
should be pared, and strawberries and raspberries
carefully washed. All of these ices are delicious, and
most wholesome and grateful in very warm weather,
or for feverish conditions when fruit is allowed. If
there is a question about seeds, as might be the case
in using strawberries, strain the fruit through a coarse
wire strainer after it is mashed; it is advisable to do
this always in making strawberry, raspberry, or pineapple
ice.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">COOKED FRUITS</h3>

<h4>BAKED TART APPLES</h4>

<p>Select fair, sound, tart apples. Wash and wipe
them, and cut out the cores with an apple-corer, being
careful to remove everything that is not clear pulp.
Sometimes the tough husk which surrounds the seeds
extends farther than the instrument will reach with
once cutting; this can be detected by looking into
the apple, and removing with the point of the corer
anything that remains. If there are dark blotches
or battered places on the outside of the apple, cut
them off. Everything of that kind is valueless as
food, and injures the flavor of that which is good.</p>

<p>When they are prepared place the apples in an
earthen baking dish (granite-ware will do), put a
teaspoon of sugar and half an inch of dried lemon-peel,
or fresh peel cut very thin, into each hole, pour
boiling water into the dish until it is an inch deep,
and bake in a moderately hot oven; when the skins
begin to shrink and the apples are perfectly soft all
the way through, they are done; then take them from
the oven, arrange them in a glass dish, and pour
around them the syrupy juice that is left.</p>

<p>The time for baking varies, according to the species
of apple, from half an hour to two hours. They should
be basted once or twice during the time with the water
which is around them. It will nearly all evaporate
while they are baking. If the apples are Baldwins, or
Greenings, or any others of fine flavor, the lemon-peel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
may be omitted. Stick cinnamon may be used instead
of lemon-peel for apples which are not quite sour.</p>

<h4>BAKED SWEET APPLES</h4>

<p>Prepare sweet apples according to the foregoing
rule, except use a fourth of a square inch of cinnamon
instead of the lemon-peel, and half a teaspoon of sugar
for each apple. Sweet apples require two or three
hours' baking. They should be cooked until perfectly
soft, and until the juice which oozes out becomes
gelatinous. Serve cold with sweet cream. Cooked
apples are an excellent addition to a diet. They contain
acids and salts of great value.</p>

<h4>STEWED APPLES</h4>

<p>Pare and quarter three slightly sour apples. Put
them into a saucepan with a cup of water and two
tablespoons of sugar, and stew gently until they are
soft, but not broken. Each piece should be whole,
but soft and tender. A tablespoon of lemon-juice put
in just before they are taken from the fire is a good
addition to make if the apples are poor in flavor; or,
lemon-peel may be used, and also cinnamon and cloves.</p>

<h4>APPLE COMPOTE</h4>

<p>Wash and wipe some fair, well-flavored apples (not
sweet). Core them with an apple-corer (not a knife),
being careful not to leave in any of the hulls, which
sometimes penetrate far into the fruit; pare them
evenly, so that they will be smooth and of good shape.
Then boil them gently, in water enough to just reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
their tops, with a square inch or two of thin lemon-peel,
and a teaspoon of sugar for each apple, until
they are soft, but not broken, watching them carefully
toward the last part of the cooking, lest they go to
pieces. When done lift them out into a glass dish,
reduce the water by further boiling until it is somewhat
syrupy, and set it aside to cool. Fill the holes
with apple, grape, or any bright-colored jelly, and
when the syrup is cold pour it over and around the
apples.</p>

<h4>STEWED PRUNES</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of prunes.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Pints of water.<br />
¼ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of lemon-juice.<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the prunes in warm water for fifteen minutes,
to soften the dust and dirt on the outside. Then
wash them carefully with the fingers, rejecting those
that feel granular (they are worm-eaten); stew them
gently in the sugar and water in a covered saucepan
for two hours. Just before taking them from the fire
put in the lemon-juice. They should be plump, soft,
and tender to the stone. As the water evaporates
the amount should be restored, so that there will be
as much at the end as at the beginning of the cooking.
French prunes may not require quite so long
time for cooking as most ordinary kinds.</p>

<h4>CRANBERRY SAUCE AND JELLY</h4>

<p>Pick out the soft and decayed ones from a quantity
of Cape cranberries; measure a pint, and put with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
it <em>half</em> the bulk of sugar, and <em>one fourth</em> the bulk of
water. Stew the berries ten minutes without stirring,
counting the time from the moment when they
are actually bubbling. Done in this way, the skins
will be tender, and the juice on cooling will form a
delicate jelly. Or, the fruit may be pressed through
a soup-strainer and the whole made into jelly.</p>

<h4>GRAPE SAUCE</h4>

<p>Take any small quantity of grapes. Wash them by
dipping each bunch several times in water, unless you
know that they have been gathered and handled by
clean hands. Separate the skins from the pulps by
squeezing each grape between the fingers and thumb.
Cook the pulps about five minutes, or until soft
and broken. Cook the skins for the same length of
time in a separate saucepan, then press the pulps
through a strainer into them, until there is nothing
left but the seeds. Measure the mixture, and for
each measure, pint or cup, as the case may be, add
half a measure of sugar, and simmer for five minutes.
Many invalids who cannot eat grapes uncooked, on
account of the seeds, may take them stewed in this
way. More or less than the above amount of sugar
may be used, according to the requirements of the
individual.</p>

<h4>GRAPE JELLY</h4>

<p>Separate the pulps from the skins of a quantity of
washed grapes. Cook each separately for a few minutes,
and slowly, so as not to evaporate the juice.
Press the pulps through a soup-strainer, mashing
them if they are not broken, until there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
left but the seeds; strain into this the juice from the
skins, mashing and squeezing out all that is possible.
Measure the mixture, and for every cup add a cup of
sugar. Put all into a granite-ware saucepan and boil
slowly for ten or twelve minutes.</p>

<p>The time required for cooking depends upon the
condition of the grapes. If they are very ripe, and
it is late in the season, ten minutes is sufficient time
to obtain a fine, delicate jelly; but if it is early in the
autumn, and the fruit has not been as thoroughly
changed by nature as late in the season, twelve or
fifteen minutes will be required to obtain the same
result. Even less than ten minutes' cooking will
sometimes cause the pectin of the fruit to dissolve,
which, on cooling, forms the jelly. The time required
will always be variable, according to the condition
of the fruit, so it is well to ascertain by experiment
what number of minutes gives the desired result.</p>

<p>Another and important point to notice in making
fruit jellies is, that if the fruit be cooked longer than
is necessary to dissolve the jelly-forming substance,
that is the pectin, the natural flavor of the fruit is
more or less injured; consequently, if grapes which
require only ten minutes' boiling are boiled for fifteen,
the flavor is inferior to what it would be if they
were exposed for the lesser time.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give a rule which shall at all
times apply to the making of fruit jellies, on account
of the always variable condition of the fruit. But
in general, grapes, cranberries, currants, and similar
fruits require a short time, while apples, crab-apples,
lemons, and oranges will take from one and a half to
three hours. One is therefore obliged to test the jelly
at intervals by taking out a little on a saucer to cool.
If it becomes firm quickly, the mixture is cooked
enough; if not, one may get an idea, from the consistency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
which it has, what further cooking will be
necessary.</p>

<h4>APPLE JELLY</h4>

<p>Wash and wipe good tart apples. Cut them in
quarters or, better, eighths, but do not pare them.
Stew them in half their bulk of water,&mdash;that is, if
you have four quarts of cut apples, put in two quarts
of water,&mdash;until the skins as well as the pulp are
perfectly soft. No definite time can be given, because
that depends upon the kind and ripeness of the fruit.
When done, turn them into a jelly-bag and drain
until the juice is all out. Measure it, and for each cup
add a cup of sugar, one clove, and one square inch of
thin lemon-peel. Simmer gently for half an hour,
then test it, to see how near the jellying-point it is,
by taking out a little into a cool saucer. With some
kinds of apples it will be done in that time, with
others it will take an hour or more longer. When a
little becomes firm on cooling, remove the whole immediately
from the fire, skim it, and strain it into
jars or tumblers which have been thoroughly washed
in soap and water, and have been standing in boiling
water for some minutes.</p>

<p>When the jelly is cool, pour over the surface a thin
coating of melted paraffin, let it harden, then pour
in another; for, as the first hardens, it may crack or
shrink from the sides and leave spaces where ferments
may enter; in other words, the jars need to be
made air-tight&mdash;not that the air does mischief, but because
it contains the organisms which, on entering the
jelly, cause by their growth the various fermentative
changes known to occur in fruits. The object then
will be to exclude all micro-organisms.</p>

<p>There are other ways of sealing jelly than by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
use of paraffin, as, for instance, with paper soaked in
alcohol, or coated with oil; but paraffin, if properly
used, is a sure, easy, and economical means.</p>

<p>A wad of sterilized cotton batting, packed into the
mouth of the jar or tumbler, like a stopper, is sometimes
employed, but it is not as effectual as the
paraffin; for that, being poured in hot, sterilizes the
surface of the jelly, thus killing any organisms that
may have lodged upon it during the cooling. Organisms
cannot go through batting; but, though it may
be properly sterilized, it cannot be packed over the
jelly until it has become firm, and during the time
ferments may have settled upon it. Paraffin is a most
satisfactory means of preserving jelly, and the only
precaution necessary in using it is to put on two layers,
the second one two or three hours after the first,
or when all contraction has ceased.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">BREAD</h3>

<p>The two most practicable methods of making bread
are with yeast, and with cream of tartar and bicarbonate
of soda.</p>

<p>Yeast is a micro-organism&mdash;an exceedingly minute
form of plant life&mdash;which by its growth produces
carbonic acid and alcohol. When this growth
takes place in a mass of flour dough, the carbonic
acid generated, in its effort to escape, puffs it up, but,
owing to the viscous nature of the gluten, it is entangled
and held within. Each little bubble of gas
occupies a certain space. When the bread is baked,
the walls around these spaces harden in the heat, and
thus we get the porous loaf.</p>

<p>Barley, rye, and some other grains would be very
useful for bread if it were not that they lack sufficient
gluten to entangle enough carbonic acid to
render bread made from them light.</p>

<p>Good bread cannot be made without good flour.
There are two kinds usually to be found in market,
namely <em>bread</em> flour, and <em>pastry</em> flour. The former is
prepared in such a way that it contains more gluten
than the latter. In making Pastry, or St. Louis flour,
as it is sometimes called, the grain is crushed in such
a manner that the starch, being most easily broken,
becomes finer than the gluten, and in the process of
bolting some of the latter is lost. For pastry and
cake this kind is best. Lacking gluten, bread made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
from it is more tender, whiter, but less nutritious
than that made from so-called <em>bread</em> flour.</p>

<p>New Process, or bread flour may be distinguished
by the "feel," which is slightly granular rather than
powdery, by its yellow color, and by the fact that it
does not "cake" when squeezed in the hand; while
St. Louis is white, powdery, and will "cake."</p>

<p>The best method to pursue in buying flour is, first,
to find a good dealer, upon whose advice you may
rely. Next, take a sample of the flour recommended
and, with a recipe which you have <em>proved</em> to be correct,
try some; if the first loaf of bread is not satisfactory,
try another, and then another, until you are
confident that the fault lies in the flour, and not in
the method of making. Finally, having found a
brand of flour from which you can make yellow-white
instead of snow-white bread, which has a nutty, sweet
flavor, which in mixing absorbs much liquid, and
does not "run" after you think you have got it stiff
enough, and which feels puffy and elastic to the hand
after molding, keep it; it is probably good.</p>

<p>Often the same flour is sold in different sections
of the country under different names, so that it is
impossible to recommend any special brand. Each
buyer must ascertain for herself which brands in her
locality are best. It is just as easy to have good
bread as poor. It only requires a <em>little</em> care and a
<em>little</em> intelligence on the part of the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Having found a brand of good flour, next give your
attention to yeast. In these days, when excellent
compressed yeasts may be found in all markets, it is
well to use them, bearing in mind that they <em>are</em> compressed,
and that a very small quantity contains a
great many yeast cells, and will raise bread as well, if
not better, than a large amount.</p>

<p>Home-made liquid yeast is exceedingly easy to prepare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
It simply requires a mixture of water and
some material in which the plant cells will rapidly
grow. Grated raw potato, cooked by pouring on
boiling water, flour, and sugar form an excellent
food for their propagation. A recipe for yeast will
be given later.</p>

<p>Now we have come to the consideration of what
will take place when the two, flour and yeast, are made
into dough. According to some accounts of the subject,
the yeast begins to act first upon the starch, converting
it into sugar (glucose C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>). While this
is taking place there is no <em>apparent</em> change, for nothing
else is formed except the glucose, or sugar.
Then this sugar is changed into alcohol and carbonic
acid; the latter, owing to its diffusive nature,
endeavors to escape, but becomes entangled in the
viscous mass and swells it to several times its original
bulk.</p>

<p>This has been the accepted explanation; it is now,
however, believed not to be correct. It is thought,
and I believe demonstrated, that the yeast plant
lives upon sugar; that it has not the power to act directly
upon starch, but that it is capable of <em>producing</em>
a substance which acts upon starch to convert it
into sugar.</p>

<p>The production of the carbonic acid is the end of
desirable chemical change, and when it has been
carried to a sufficient degree to fill the dough with
bubbles, it should be stopped.</p>

<p>Kneading bread is for the purpose of distributing
the gas and breaking up the large bubbles into small
ones, to give the loaf a fine grain. One will immediately
see that kneading before the bread is raised
is a more or less useless task. Kneading is a process
which should be done gently, by handling the dough
with great tenderness; for if it is pressed hard against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the molding-board, the bubbles will be worked out
through the surface, and the loaf consequently less
porous than if all the gas is kept in it.</p>

<p>The best temperature for the raising of bread (in
other words, for the growing of yeast) during the first
part of the process is from 70° to 75° Fahr. It may
touch 80° without harm, but 90° is the limit. Above
that acetic fermentation is liable to occur, and the
bread becomes sour. When the bread is made into
loaves, it may be placed in a very warm temperature,
to rise quickly if it is intended for immediate baking.
Besides killing the yeast, the object sought in baking
is to form a sheath of cooked dough all over the outside,
for a skeleton or support for the inside mass
while it is cooking. Baking also expands the carbonic
acid, and volatilizes the alcohol. The latter is lost.</p>

<p>A good temperature in which to begin the baking
of bread is 400° Fahr. This may gradually decrease
to not lower than 250°, and the time, for a good-sized
brick loaf, is one hour. If it is a large loaf, increase
the time by a quarter or a half hour.</p>

<p>"The expansion of water or ice into 1700 times its
volume of steam, is sometimes taken advantage of in
making snow bread, water gems, etc. It plays a part
in the lightening of pastry and crackers. Air at 70°
Fahr. expands to about twice its volume at the temperature
of a hot oven, so that if air is entangled in
a mass of dough it gives a certain lightness when the
whole is baked. This is the cause of the sponginess
of cakes made with eggs. The viscous albumen
catches the air and holds it."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>There are other means of obtaining carbonic acid
to lighten bread, besides by the growing of yeast.
The most convenient, perhaps the most valuable,
method is by causing cream of tartar and bicarbonate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of soda to unite chemically. (The products of
the union are carbonic acid and Rochelle salts.) The
advantage of using these over everything else yet
tried is, that they do not unite when brought in contact
except in the presence of water and a certain
degree of heat. Rochelle salts, taken in such minute
quantities as it occurs in bread made in this way, is
not harmful.</p>

<p>Cream of tartar bread, if <em>perfectly</em> made, is more
nutritious than fermented bread, for none of the constituents
of the flour are lost, as when yeast is used.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining good cream of tartar is
very great. It is said to be more extensively adulterated
than any other substance used for food. Moreover,
in the practice of bread-making the cream of
tartar and soda are generally mixed in the proportion
of two to one&mdash;that is, two teaspoons of cream of
tartar to every teaspoon of soda; but this is not the
<em>exact</em> proportion in which they neutralize each other,
so that under ordinary circumstances there is an excess
of soda in the bread.</p>

<p>To be exact they should always be combined by
weight, as is done in making baking-powders, the proportion
being 84 parts of soda to 188 of cream of
tartar, or, reducing to lower terms, as 21 to 47&mdash;a little
less than half as much soda as cream of tartar. For
practical use in cooking there are no scales known to
the author for the purpose of weighing these materials,
so the proportion will have to be approximated
with teaspoons, and a fairly accurate result for bread-making
may be obtained most easily by measuring
a teaspoon of each in exactly the same manner, and
then taking off a little from the soda.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>
<p>With good materials, care in measuring them, and
a hot oven to set the bread before the gas escapes,
cream of tartar biscuits are both wholesome and
palatable.</p>

<h4>LIQUID YEAST</h4>

<p class="pfs90">(HOME-MADE WITH GRATED POTATO)</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Medium-sized potato.<br />
1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
1 Tablespoon of flour.<br />
1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
1½ Pints of boiling water.<br />
⅕ of a two-cent cake of Fleischmann's yeast.<br />
</div>

<p>First see that there is a supply of boiling water.
Then put the salt, sugar, and flour together in a
mixing-bowl. Wash and peel the potato, and grate
it quickly into the bowl, covering it now and then
with the flour to prevent discoloring. As soon as the
potato is all grated, pour in the boiling water and
stir. It will form into a somewhat thick paste at
once. Set it aside to cool. Then dissolve the yeast
in a little cold water, add it, and set the mixture to
rise in a temperature of 70° to 80° Fahr.</p>

<p>In a short time bubbles will begin to appear; these
are carbonic acid, showing that the alcoholic stage of
the fermentation has begun. In six or eight hours
the whole will be a mass of yeast cells, which have
grown in the nutrient liquid. It is then ready for
use. It should be bottled in wide-mouthed glass or
earthen jars, and kept in a cool place. It will remain
good for two weeks. At the end of that time make a
fresh supply.</p>

<p>Yeast is an organism&mdash;a microscopic form of plant
life&mdash;which grows by a species of budding with great
rapidity when it finds lodgment in material suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
for its food. The dissolved compressed yeast is like
seed, which, when put into a fruitful soil, grows so
long as sustenance lasts.</p>

<h4>WATER BREAD</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of boiling water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of butter.<br />
⅓ Cup of liquid yeast, or<br />
⅕ of a two-cent cake of Fleischmann's yeast.<br />
Enough sifted flour to make a stiff dough.<br />
</div>

<p>Put the sugar, salt, and butter with the boiling
water into a mixing-bowl or bread-pan. Stir until
the sugar is dissolved and the water lukewarm, then
add the yeast (if compressed, it should be dissolved in
a little water). Last, stir in the flour until a dough
stiff enough to mold easily is made. Mold it for a
minute or two to give it shape and to more thoroughly
mix the ingredients, and then set it to rise in a room
warm enough to be comfortable to live in&mdash;that is,
having a temperature of 70° Fahr. It should remain
in this temperature for eight hours. Cover it closely,
that the top may not dry.</p>

<p>It is often convenient to let bread rise over night.
There is no objection to this, provided the bread is
mixed late in the evening, and baked early the next
morning. Care must be taken, however, that the
room in which it is left is warm enough to insure rising
in the time given. On the other hand, if allowed
to rise too long, or at too high a temperature, the fermentation
is carried so far that an acid is produced,
and the dough becomes sour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Eight hours at 70° Fahr. is a good rule to keep in
mind. During the time of raising the dough should
double itself in bulk. If this does not happen, or it
does not appear to have risen at all, either the yeast
was not good, or the temperature was too low.</p>

<p>When the bread has risen sufficiently, cut it down,
and knead it for five minutes on a bread-board, to
distribute the gas and break the large bubbles, so that
the bread may have an even grain; then shape it into
a loaf, put it into an oiled baking-pan, and let it rise
quickly in a warm place, until it again doubles itself.
The amount of dough indicated in the rule will make
one large loaf, or a medium-sized loaf and some biscuit.
Multiply the rule by two if you want two loaves.
Bake the bread in an oven which is hot at first, but
gradually decreases in temperature, for an hour and
a quarter. If you have an oven thermometer use it.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h4>MILK BREAD</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of <em>scalded</em> milk.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
⅓ Cup of liquid yeast, or<br />
⅕ Cake of Fleischmann's yeast.<br />
</div>

<p>Measure the milk after scalding, but otherwise proceed
exactly as in the making of water bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<h4>STICKS</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of <em>scalded</em> milk.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of butter.<br />
⅕ Cake of yeast, or<br />
¼ Cup of liquid yeast.<br />
White of one egg.<br />
Flour enough to make a slightly soft dough.<br />
</div>

<p>Dissolve the salt and sugar, and soften the butter in
the hot milk, which must be measured <em>after</em> heating.
When it is cooled to lukewarmness, put in the yeast
(which, if compressed, should be dissolved in a little cold
water), the beaten white of the egg, and flour enough
to make a dough <em>slightly</em> softer than that for ordinary
bread. Let it rise overnight, or until light. Then cut it
into small pieces, shape the pieces into balls, and roll
and stretch them into tiny slender sticks, from ten to
twelve inches long, about half an inch thick in the
middle, and tapering toward each end. Place them,
two inches apart, in shallow, buttered pans, and put
them in a warm place for an hour to rise; then bake
them in a moderate oven fifteen or twenty minutes, or
until they are a golden brown. Sticks are good at any
time; they are especially nice served with soup, or for
lunch, with cocoa or tea.</p>

<p>This dough may also be made into tiny loaves for
tea-rolls.</p>

<h4>RUSK</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of <em>scalded</em> milk.<br />
¼ Cup of liquid yeast, or<br />
⅙ Cake of compressed yeast.<br />
Flour enough to make a soft dough.<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the above ingredients together, and let the
dough rise overnight in the usual time given to
bread. Then beat one-fourth of a cup of butter, one-fourth
of a cup of sugar, and one egg together, and
work the mixture into the dough, adding a little more
flour to make it stiff enough to mold. Set it to rise a
second time; then shape it into rolls or tiny loaves,
allow them to rise again until quite light, or for an
hour in a warm place, and bake like bread.</p>

<h4>DRIED RUSK</h4>

<p>Cut the rusk when cold into thin slices, dry them
slowly in the oven, and then brown them a delicate
golden color.</p>

<p>Dried rusk is exceedingly easy of digestion, and
makes a delicious lunch with a glass of warm milk
or a cup of tea.</p>

<h4>GRAHAM BREAD</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Pint of milk.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
⅕ Cake of compressed yeast.<br />
&nbsp;2 Cups of white flour.<br />
Enough Graham flour to make a dough.<br />
</div>

<p>Scald some milk, and from it measure a pint; to
this add the sugar and salt. While it is cooling sift
some Graham flour, being careful to exclude the chaff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
or outside silicious covering of the grain, but <em>nothing
else</em>. When the milk has become lukewarm, put in
the yeast, which has previously been dissolved in a
little cold water, and the white flour (sifted), with
enough of the Graham to make a dough which shall
be stiff, but yet not stiff enough to mold. Mix thoroughly,
and shape it with a spoon into a round mass
in the dish. After this follow the same directions as
for water bread, letting it rise the same time, and
baking it in the same manner.</p>

<p>After the dough has risen, although it is soft, it
can be <em>shaped into a loaf</em> on the bread-board, but not
molded.</p>

<h4>CREAM-OF-TARTAR BISCUIT</h4>

<p>First, attend to the fire; see that you have a clear,
steady one, such as will give a hot oven by the time
the biscuits are ready for baking. Then sift some
flour, and measure a quart. Into it put two teaspoons
of cream of tartar, and one of soda, the latter
to be measured exactly like the teaspoons of cream of
tartar, and then a very little taken off. This is a
more accurate way of getting a scanted teaspoon than
by taking some on the spoon and guessing at it. Add
one teaspoon of salt, and sift all together four times,
then with the fingers rub into the flour one spoon of
butter.</p>

<p>At this point, if it has not been already done, get
the baking-pans, rolling-pin, board, dredging-box, and
cutter ready for use. Then with a knife stir into the
flour enough milk to make a soft dough. Do this as
quickly as convenient, and without any delay mold
the dough just enough to shape it; roll it out, cut it
into biscuits, and put them immediately into the oven,
where they should bake for thirty minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pocket-Books.</b> Work or knead together the pieces
that are left after making cream-of-tartar biscuit (or
make a dough on purpose), roll it out very thin, cut
it into rounds, brush them over with milk or melted
butter, fold once so as to make a half-moon shape,
and you will have "pocket-books."</p>

<p><b>Twin Biscuit.</b> Roll out some dough very thin, cut
it into very small rounds, and place one on top of
another, with butter between.</p>

<p>Iced water may be substituted for milk in the above
rule. In baking, however, the oven should be unusually
hot, so as to take advantage of the expansion of
the water. Also, baking-powder may be substituted
for the cream of tartar and soda, using a fourth more
of the baking-powder than of the two together.</p>

<h4>SNOW-CAKES</h4>

<div class="recipe">
½ Tablespoon of butter.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of sugar.<br />
Whites of two eggs.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Cups of flour.<br />
&nbsp;1 Saltspoon of salt.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Teaspoons of baking-powder.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of milk.<br />
</div>

<p>Measure each of the ingredients carefully, then sift
the flour, salt, and baking-powder together four times.
Cream the butter and sugar with a little of the milk,
then add the whites of the eggs well beaten, the rest
of the milk, and last the flour. Bake this batter in
hot buttered gem-pans from twenty minutes to half
an hour. These cakes are delicious eaten hot for
lunch or tea. This mixture may also be baked in
small, round earthen cups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h4>GRAHAM GEMS</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of milk.<br />
½ Teaspoon of salt.<br />
½ Cup of white flour.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of Graham flour.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of cream of tartar.<br />
½ Teaspoon of soda (<em>slightly</em> scanted).<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of melted butter.<br />
</div>

<p>Sift and measure the Graham flour, add the cream
of tartar, soda, and white flour, and sift again. Mix
the milk, salt, and sugar together, and stir it into the
flour; last, put in the melted butter, beat for a minute,
and then drop a spoonful in each division of a
roll gem-pan, which should be well buttered, and
made very hot on the top of the stove. Bake in a
hot oven from twenty-five minutes to half an hour.
Serve hot.</p>

<h4>OATMEAL MUFFINS</h4>

<div class="recipe">
2¼ Cups of flour.<br />
2 Teaspoons of baking-powder.<br />
1 Teaspoon of salt.<br />
2 Tablespoons of sugar.<br />
1 Egg.<br />
1 Cup of milk.<br />
1 Cup of cooked oatmeal.<br />
1 Tablespoon of butter melted.<br />
</div>

<p>Sift the flour and baking-powder together twice.
Beat the egg very light, stir into it the salt, sugar,
and milk, then add the flour, and last the oatmeal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
butter; beat for half a minute, and bake immediately
in gem-pans or muffin-rings in a hot oven for
half an hour.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;The oatmeal should not be cooked to a soft,
thin mush, but should be rather dry; so, in preparing
it, use less water than for porridge. These cakes are
to be eaten hot.</p>

<h4>GLUTEN BREAD</h4>

<p>Gluten flour is prepared in such a way that much
of the starch of the grain is excluded. It is frequently
required for persons suffering with diabetes, who
cannot digest either sugar or starch. It should be
made with flour, water, yeast, and salt only. Do not
use milk for mixing, as it contains sugar.</p>

<p>One pint of water, one half teaspoon of salt, one
fifth of a cake of yeast, one tablespoon of butter, and
enough flour to make the usual bread dough will be
required. Otherwise the process is exactly the same as
for ordinary bread.</p>

<h4>BAKING-POWDER</h4>

<p>Baking-powder is a mixture of cream of tartar, bicarbonate
of soda, and arrowroot. The latter is used
to keep the two chemicals dry, and thus prevent the
slow union which would otherwise take place. Sometimes
tartaric acid is used instead of cream of tartar.
The following rule may be relied upon:</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Tartaric acid</td><td class="tdl">2 oz. by weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Bicarbonate of soda</td><td class="tdl">3 &nbsp; " &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Arrowroot</td><td class="tdl">3 &nbsp; " &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mix and sift together thoroughly. Keep in a dry
place, in a wide-mouthed bottle.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">CAKE</h3>

<p>Cake of the simpler kinds, especially sponge cake,
is frequently given to the sick. Good sponge cake,
served with sweet cream or a glass of milk, is an excellent
lunch for an invalid. Some of the plain kinds
of butter cakes&mdash;those made with a little butter&mdash;such
as white, feather, and similar varieties, are excellent
food.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment what they contain: eggs,
milk, butter, sugar, and flour&mdash;five of the most valuable
of all our food products. Yet there are those
who pride themselves upon not eating cake, which
idiosyncrasy can only be explained in one of two
ways: either the cake which they have had has not
been properly made, or else it has been so good
that, during a lapse of judgment, they have eaten
too much.</p>

<p>The dark fruit cakes should be avoided by both
sick and well, on account of the indigestible nature
of the dried fruits used in them, and also because they
are often compact and close-grained, not light.</p>

<p>There is a custom prevalent in many kitchens of
using what is called "cooking" butter&mdash;that is, butter
which is off taste or rancid&mdash;for cake. It is but poor
economy, even if it can merit that name at all. If
you have no other butter for cake, don't make any.
Sweet butter and fresh&mdash;not "store"&mdash;eggs are <em>absolutely
necessary</em>. Also, a dainty worker to mix the
ingredients with accuracy and care, and to oil the pan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in which the cake is to be baked, so that the outside
shall not taste of fat. Many an otherwise nice cake
has been spoiled by oiling the pan in which it was
baked with dirty or rancid grease. Use a very little
sweet butter or olive-oil.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<h4 class="fwnormal fs90">THE PROCESS OF CAKE MAKING</h4>

<p>All ordinary cakes are made in much the same way
as to the order in which their ingredients are mixed.
First the butter and sugar are creamed together, then
the yolks of the eggs are beaten and added, with the
milk, to the butter and sugar; then the flour, into
which the cream of tartar and soda have been well
mixed by sifting them together several times, is put
in; and last, the beaten whites of the eggs.</p>

<p><b>Care in Baking.</b> For sponge cake made with baking-powder,
or soda and cream of tartar, an oven
moderately heated will be required&mdash;that is, one of
300° Fahr., or one which will <em>slightly</em> brown a loaf in
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>For sponge cake made without raising material,
such as the old-fashioned kind, in which only eggs,
sugar, and flour are used, a slow oven is necessary.</p>

<p>For butter cakes a temperature somewhere between
350° and 380° will not fail.</p>

<p>The baking of cake is the most difficult part of the
process, on account of the constantly variable condition
of ovens in common iron stoves, and because it is
more easily spoiled than bread and other foods usually
cooked in an oven. One is obliged to exercise a new
judgment every time cake is made. Even thermometers
are only a partial help, for if an oven has a temperature
of 300° Fahr. at a certain time, there is no
means of being sure what the temperature will be half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
an hour from then. However, by giving attention
and some practice to it, one may gain considerable
skill in managing fires. Should the cake be cooking
too fast, and arranging the stove dampers does not
lessen the heat, a piece of buttered paper laid over
the top will protect it, and will not stick. Layer, or
thin cakes, require a hotter oven than loaves.</p>

<p>Pans for baking cake should be lined with buttered
paper (the buttered side up), letting it overlap the
sides for about an inch to assist in lifting out the
cake. An earthenware bowl and a wooden spoon
should be used for mixing.</p>

<p>Get everything ready before beginning to mix cake,
the oven first of all. Bake as soon as possible after
the flour is in, for carbonic acid begins to be formed
as soon as the soda and cream of tartar come in contact
with the liquid, and some of it will escape unless
the mixture is baked at once. Do not stop to scrape
every bit from the bowl; that can be attended to afterward,
and a little patty-cake made of what is left.</p>

<h4>INVALID'S SPONGE CAKE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;2 Cups of pastry flour measured after sifting.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of cream of tartar.<br />
½ Teaspoon of soda (slightly scanted).<br />
&nbsp;4 Eggs.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Cups of powdered sugar.<br />
½ Cup of water.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of lemon-juice.<br />
</div>

<p>Get everything ready before beginning to make
the cake; oil the pan, or oil paper and line the pan
with it; measure the flour, cream of tartar, and soda,
and sift them together four times; measure the sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
water, and lemon-juice, and separate the yolks from
the whites of the eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs
with half the sugar until they are very light. Then
beat the yolks very light, or until they become lemon-colored,
add the remaining half of the sugar and beat
again, and then a little of the water if it is difficult to
turn the egg-beater. When the sugar is well mixed,
add the remainder of the water, the lemon-juice, and
the flour. Beat for a few seconds, but not long, as all
mixtures that have cream of tartar and soda should
be baked as quickly as possible. Last of all <em>fold</em> in
(not beat) the whites of the eggs lightly, so as not to
break out the air which has been entangled by the
beating, as it helps to make the cake light.</p>

<p>Bake in a moderate oven from forty-five to fifty
minutes, or until the cake shrinks a little from the
pan.</p>

<h4>FEATHER CAKE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
¼ Cup of butter.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;2 Eggs.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Cups of pastry flour.<br />
½ Teaspoon of soda (slightly scanted).<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of cream of tartar.<br />
A little grated nutmeg.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of vanilla.<br />
</div>

<p>See first of all that you have a proper fire. Measure
the ingredients, and get everything ready before beginning&mdash;mixing-bowl,
pans, etc. Use a wooden cake
spoon, with slits in the bowl, for mixing. Line the
pans with buttered paper. Then cream the butter,
adding to it half the sugar and half the milk, the
latter very slowly; separate the yolks of the eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
from the whites, and beat them with the remaining
sugar; when they are very light add the rest of the
milk. Beat the whites until stiff. Now mix the
creamed butter and yolks together with the flavoring,
then stir in the flour, and last the whites, which
are to be cut and folded in, <em>not beaten</em>. Bake it in
shallow pans in a moderate oven forty minutes, or
about that time. When the cake begins to shrink a
little from the sides of the pan, there is no doubt that
it is cooked enough. This recipe may be used for a
variety of plain cakes.</p>

<p><b>For Chocolate Cake.</b> Melt and stir into the above
mixture two ounces of Baker's chocolate, or two teaspoons
of cocoa wet in a little warm water.</p>

<p><b>For Rose Cake.</b> Color the feather cake mixture with
six drops of carmine.</p>

<h4>LAYER CAKE</h4>

<p>Oil three layer cake pans, or pie-plates. Make the
feather cake mixture, and divide it into three portions.
Bake one white, color another pink with three
or four drops of carmine, and the third brown with
an ounce of melted chocolate. Bake in a hot oven
for fifteen minutes. When cool, join the layers with
White Mountain frosting, and frost the top of the last
layer. Any of the fillings given under the head of
"Cake Filling" may also be used.</p>

<p>When chocolate is used in cake, it is not necessary
to grate it or even to break it into small pieces. It
contains a large proportion of fat which liquefies at
a low temperature, consequently it is necessary only
to heat it slowly to reduce it to the liquid state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<h4>CARMINE FOR COLORING</h4>

<p>The following rule for making liquid carmine for
coloring cake, ice-cream, blanc-mange, etc., will be
found useful:</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Ounce of No. 40 carmine.<br />
3 Ounces of boiling water.<br />
1 Ounce of ammonia.<br />
</div>

<p>Bottle for use. It will keep indefinitely.</p>

<h4>WHITE CAKE</h4>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of butter.<br />
&nbsp;1 Cup of sugar (powdered).<br />
&nbsp;1¼ Cups of pastry flour.<br />
½ Teaspoon of soda.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of cream of tartar.<br />
Whites of four eggs.<br />
¼ Teaspoon of almond extract, or<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of rose-water.<br />
</div>

<p>Proceed, as with all cake mixtures, by getting everything
ready before beginning to mix any of the ingredients,
not forgetting the fire. Then cream the
butter with the sugar, and add the milk to it slowly,
so that the cream shall not break. Beat the whites of
the eggs very stiff. Then to the butter, sugar, etc.,
add the flour, with which the cream of tartar and soda
have been sifted at least four times, and the flavoring;
last, fold in the whites of the eggs, and bake in a round
loaf for an hour and a quarter or an hour and a half in
a <em>slow</em> oven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h4>DREAM CAKE</h4>

<p>Make a white cake mixture. Bake it in shallow
layer-cake pans, in a moderate, not slow, oven. Join
them with a caramel filling, and frost the top with
the same, or use White Mountain frosting instead of
the caramel, flavored with rose-water, and left either
white, or colored a delicate shell pink with carmine.</p>

<h4>CAKE FILLING AND FROSTING</h4>

<h5>WHITE MOUNTAIN FROSTING</h5>

<p>Boil together, <em>without stirring</em>, one cup of granulated
sugar with one third of a cup of boiling water,
for eight or ten minutes. When the sugar has been
boiling five minutes, beat the white of one egg until
it is very light. Then test the sugar mixture by letting
a little run off the side of a spoon. If in falling
it forms a delicate thread, it is just at the point to
stop the boiling. When it has reached this point,
pour it at once into the beaten egg in a small stream,
stirring the egg constantly to keep it smooth. Continue
stirring for two or three minutes until it begins
to thicken, then spread it either between layer cakes
for filling, or use it for frosting.</p>

<h5>CARAMEL FILLING</h5>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;1 Cup of brown sugar.<br />
¼ Cup of sweet cream.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of butter.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil all together until it threads, stirring it slowly
as it boils. It will take about eight minutes. Use
either for frosting or filling.</p>

<h5>CHOCOLATE ICING</h5>

<div class="recipe">
½ Cup of sugar.<br />
&nbsp;4 Tablespoons of water.<br />
&nbsp;2 Eggs.<br />
&nbsp;1 Ounce of chocolate, or<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of Dutch cocoa.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of vanilla.<br />
</div>

<p>Boil the sugar, water, and chocolate together, two
minutes, to render the chocolate smooth. Then add
the beaten eggs. Cook two minutes more, stirring
slowly and gently. Add the vanilla just as it is taken
from the fire, and use at once, as it becomes firm
quickly. It is good either for icing cakes or for
filling.</p>

<h5>CREAM FILLING</h5>

<p>Make a cream sauce with one cup of milk, a tablespoon
of butter, and a tablespoon of flour. Beat one
egg with half a cup of sugar, and stir it into the sauce
slowly. Cook for two minutes, or until the egg is
done. It should look like a thick smooth cream.
Flavor it with a piece of cinnamon bark boiled in
the milk, or with vanilla or almond. Use this cream
for filling, for layer cakes, or split a thin sponge
cake in two, and spread it between the halves.</p>

<h3 class="h3large pg-brk">DIET LISTS OR MENUS FOR THE SICK</h3>

<p>Diet for the sick may be divided into three kinds:
Liquid, Light, and Convalescent's or Invalid's Diet.</p>

<p>Liquid diet consists entirely of liquids, of which
milk is the most valuable. The meat broths (those
made with beef, chicken, and mutton), oyster and
clam broth, albumen water, eggs in the form of egg-nog,
egg cream, and mulled wine, and tea and coffee
are excellent. To this list may be added, as the patient
shows signs of recovery, soft custards, and jellies
made with wine, lemon, coffee, or orange-juice,
which quickly become liquid when eaten.</p>

<p>A patient is given liquid diet during times of severe
and dangerous illness. Usually the amount of food
and intervals at which it is to be given are prescribed
by the physician.</p>

<p>The following table may be of assistance to those
who are without such aid:</p>

<p>If nourishment is to be given throughout the night,
either hot or warm milk or cocoa is good. They
are soothing and sometimes induce sleep. Tea and
wine whey should be avoided at night, unless, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
course, the patient needs stimulating, in which case
use the wine only, for tea often causes wakefulness.</p>

<p>The whites of eggs beaten and strained, and mixed
with finely crushed ice, is a valuable form of food
for a typhoid fever patient. Toast-water and cracker
tea are good in all feverish conditions. Milk may be
varied by making it into milk-punch, with a very little
sugar (a scanty teaspoon) and a tablespoon of brandy
or sherry to each tumbler, or it may be made with a
few drops of vanilla, instead of the brandy or sherry.</p>

<h4>LIGHT DIET</h4>

<p>Light diet consists of everything included in liquid
diet, and in addition fruits, such as grapes and
oranges; porridge of granum or farina; soft-cooked
or poached eggs; dry, water, milk, and cream toast;
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maigre</i> soups, such as celery and mock-bisque, and
chicken; delicate puddings, coffee and velvet cream,
and baked custards, with perhaps for dinner a meat
ball, a small bit of beefsteak or roast beef, and a
baked potato.</p>

<p>Jellies made with gelatine, especially when flavored
with wine, are a very valuable form of food with which
to make the transition from liquid to light diet. They
are palatable, nutritious, and, being in solid form,
are satisfying to the minds of those who think they
are not getting much to eat when fed on liquids alone.</p>

<p>The change from liquid to light diet should be
made gradually, adding one kind of solid food at a
time. Perhaps after the jellies a bit of water or milk
toast, then an egg, then a little soup or pudding, until,
as strength is gained, the person is able to take anything
in the list, and finally is able to eat almost any
kind of nutritious and well-prepared food.</p>

<h4>CONVALESCENT'S DIET</h4>

<p>Convalescent's diet includes the liquid and light
diets, and, in addition, all easily digested and nutritious
food. For meats, game, especially venison and
birds, beef, mutton, and chicken may be given, but
never either pork or veal. They are difficult of digestion.
Eggs in all ways, soft-cooked, scrambled,
poached, and as omelets, well-baked potatoes, creamed
potatoes, celery, snow pudding, cream of rice pudding,
and tapioca cream, jellies, both those made from gelatine
and fruits, Graham bread, Graham gems, rusk,
and, in fact, any well-made bread, and good cake.</p>

<p>A convalescent may use for drinks plenty of good
milk, cocoa, <em>carefully made</em> tea and coffee, occasionally
good wine, and the different mineral and drinking
waters. Some foods to be avoided are pastry,
dark or badly made cakes, pork, veal, any highly seasoned
meat dish made with gravy, all kinds of fried
food, sausages, heavy puddings, badly made bread,
lobsters and crabs.</p>

<h2><a name="SERVING" id="SERVING"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">SERVING</a></h2>

<p>If cooking be a science, then serving is an art. It
perhaps more closely resembles painting than any
other, for a well-spread table should be a picture, and
each separate dish a choice bit in the landscape. The
invalid's tray should be a dainty Dresden water-color
of delicate hues and harmonious tints.</p>

<p>It is not easy to give definite directions in regard
to serving, for it involves so much of good taste in so
many directions, and depends so largely upon the individual
and the circumstances. It requires intelligent
study, a cultivated habit of thought, and the
appreciation of symmetry, and the harmony of colors;
to do it well one must ever judge anew and arrange
again, for no two meals are exactly alike in all their
details.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Importance of Skill in Cooking</span></h3>

<p>Of course, the most important thing in serving is
the thing to be served. A badly prepared or unwholesome
dish, no matter how beautifully it may be
presented, is worthless&mdash;perhaps even worse, for it
may prove a positive source of evil. An indifferently
done steak, served on a silver platter, is less acceptable
than one perfectly cooked on plain china, or a bit
of burned toast on Dresden ware than a daintily
browned piece on a common white plate. Put the
force, therefore, of your efforts on securing that
which is wholesome in itself, adapted to the needs of
the patient, and perfectly cooked; then serve it in the
most attractive manner at your command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Good Serving a Necessity</span></h3>

<p>Good serving is a necessity for the sick. It should
never be regarded as simply ornamental. When a
person has the hunger of health, colors and dishes are
not of great account; but when one is ill, or exhausted
with fatigue, sometimes a pretty color, a dainty cup, or
beauty of arrangement makes all the difference, and
one is tempted to eat when otherwise the food would
remain untouched.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Preparation of the Invalid's Tray</span></h3>

<p>Simplicity should rule at all times the arrangement
of an invalid's tray. Anything like display is entirely
out of place. Japanned trays of oval shape are the
ones in general use. When one is fortunate enough
to possess a silver tray, the dishes may be placed directly
upon it, or on a doily, which covers the center
of it. All other trays should be completely covered
with a dainty snowy napkin, or tray-cloth.</p>

<p>After the napkin has been neatly spread upon the
tray, place a plate in the middle of the side nearest to
you, and then arrange the other dishes about it, with
the tiny earthen teapot on the right, and the sugar-bowl
and cream-pitcher of silver next to it; the knife,
fork, and spoons should be on the right and left of
the plate, never in front of it. The various dishes to
be served should then be arranged symmetrically in
other parts of the tray, not scattered about without
the appearance of order.</p>

<p>Never crowd a tray. Calculate beforehand how
many dishes you will probably have, and select a size
accordingly. Serve a single glass or a single cup on
a small round or oval tray with a doily, never on a
large tray, such as might be selected for a meal.</p>

<p>When practicable use silver dishes for meats, soups,
coffee, hot milk, or any hot food; when these cannot
be had, use hot china.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Importance of Harmony of Colors</span></h3>

<p>Avoid discords in color. Most women have an instinctive
appreciation of color, and by giving some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
thought to the subject of harmonies, and observing
the methods of others who are known to have good
taste in such matters, bad blunders in the arrangement
of a tray or a table may be avoided.</p>

<p><em>Red</em> with <em>yellow</em>, <em>blue</em> with <em>green</em>, and <em>yellow</em> with
<em>pink</em> are inharmonious combinations of color; but
<em>yellow</em> with <em>white</em>, <em>blue</em> with <em>white</em>, <em>dull orange</em> with
<em>brown</em>, <em>violet</em>, and <em>pale gold</em> are exquisite together.</p>

<p>A cup of chocolate in pale pink or dull red, coffee
in buttercup yellow, especially when served without
cream, and green tea in Nile green, appeal to the eye
as well as to the taste, giving double pleasure&mdash;gratifying
two senses instead of one.</p>

<p>Color plays a very important part in serving food.
It produces strong effects in some persons who are
deeply moved by harmonies or discords in it, as
others are by harmonies or discords in music. Color
appeals to the esthetic side of some natures much
more forcibly than many of us are aware.</p>

<p>The story is told of a lady, possessed of unusually
keen color-perception, who had been living for many
months in a house furnished in monotonous hues,
and in which the table was always set in plain white
cloth and white china. Being invited to lunch with
a friend in the neighborhood, she was moved to tears
at the sight of a beautiful table, decorated with a
scarlet cloth, flowers, and harmoniously contrasting
colored china.</p>

<p>The effect of the colors upon the emotions was similar
to that which is sometimes produced by an exquisite
strain of music. Who can say how much of
subtle refining influence may be exerted by such
things? Regarded as a general thing only in the light
of the ornamental, they are too often looked upon as
luxuries, and therefore dispensable; but whatever
ministers to the esthetic side of the mind must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
elevating, and the influence of neatness, of beautiful
surroundings, of harmonious colors, of art in any
form, inevitably produces an effect upon character.
In time such surroundings become necessities, and
when the individual is deprived of them they are
missed, and he feels a sense of dissatisfaction with
those of meaner kind&mdash;perhaps dissatisfaction with a
poorer or lower life in any way&mdash;and imperceptibly
these seeming ornaments of existence may be the
means which shall lift many an one into a higher plane
of life, so that, aside from their practical value, all the
niceties of household affairs may have a lasting effect
for good upon character.</p>

<p>To be progressive, one must be constantly in a
frame of mind to learn, and ever on the alert for information.
Fashions change in serving foods as in
other things. However, there are certain fixed principles
which always remain unchanged. Perfect
neatness, orderly and pleasing arrangement, and harmonious
coloring are ever essential.</p>

<p>For the invalid's tray use the prettiest china obtainable.
In a private house there are always some choice
and precious pieces&mdash;teacups, quaint silver pitchers
and spoons, pretty plates, and delicate thin tumblers.
These will be gladly placed at the disposal of the
sick one, especially if the nurse will volunteer to be
responsible for them.</p>

<p>To prepare a meal for an invalid after planning the
food, the first necessary articles are a tray clean on
both sides, a neat napkin to spread over it, and exquisitely
clean dishes done by a servant known to be
neat, or by one's self. It not infrequently happens,
especially in houses in which the mistress leaves everything
to the servants, and never goes into the kitchen,
that dishes are washed in such surroundings of dirt,
and wiped with such unclean towels, as to be dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
for any one to use. It is therefore necessary for
a nurse to understand about such matters, and to see
to it that her patient's dishes are above suspicion. In
fact, it is a dainty attention on her part to care entirely
for the tray-dishes of her charge.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Care of Dishes and Trays in Contagious Diseases</span></h3>

<p>In some forms of disease it is absolutely necessary,
in order to prevent contagion, that a nurse should attend
altogether to the tray and dishes, for it would
almost never occur that any member of a household
would understand an effectual method of sterilization.</p>

<p>In a contagious disease everything that goes to the
bedside&mdash;dishes, knives, forks, spoons, napkin, the
tray itself&mdash;should be rendered sterile by boiling in
water for half an hour, or by treatment with steam
for a similar time, before any one, except the nurse,
even touches them.</p>

<p>Nothing should be used in the way of linen or
dishes that cannot be washed without spoiling; therefore
fancy silk doilies and other similar furnishings
are to be avoided.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to taste of food before giving
it to a patient, take some into a separate dish, and use
a separate spoon or fork; or, if it is a liquid, take out
a little with a spoon into another spoon, being careful
that the one used for tasting does not at any time
touch the liquid.</p>

<p>Never touch the bowls of spoons, nor the inside
of plates and cups, with the fingers, unless the hands
are prepared by thorough cleansing for it. A nurse
who understands antiseptic surgery, and knows how
easily contagion is carried, will appreciate the necessity
of these precautions. The hands should be
washed after arranging a bed, using a handkerchief,
arranging the hair&mdash;in fact, always before handling
either food or dishes.</p>

<p>Food and drink should not be allowed to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
exposed to the air for any length of time. Most
kinds of food are excellent media for micro-organisms
to flourish in, and consequently the food, if it be such
as might be eaten afterward, deteriorates.</p>

<p>Then, from an esthetic point of view, it is the height
of untidiness to allow a tray to remain in the sick-room
any length of time after the meal has been eaten. It
should be immediately removed with all traces of the
meal, as should also fruit, glasses for water, lemonade,
milk, etc., which may be used at different times
during the day.</p>

<p>If the patient objects and wishes to have what is
left for future use, assure him that it is near at hand,
and being kept cool and clean for him. By punctually
fulfilling promises made about such matters, he
will very quickly learn to trust a nurse, not only in
these, but in other things.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Tray Decoration</span></h3>

<p>For decoration for a tray nothing should be used
besides pretty china and flowers. A slender glass or
silver vase with a blossom or two, or a delicate fern
with a white or pink flower, are always suitable. It
is well to use ferns and other fresh green decorations
liberally, especially in winter. Green is always grateful
to the sight, and sometimes a single spray will
give pleasure to an invalid for hours.</p>

<p>Violets, roses, orchids, and all flowers that are
dainty in themselves, are always in good taste, but a
very few or a single blossom is all that is allowable.
A big bouquet on a tray or an invalid's table is as out
of place as a whole roast or a whole pudding. Flowers
with strong odors or primary colors should be
avoided, such, for instance, as marigolds, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur de lis</span>,
and dahlias. They are handsome in a garden or a
hall, but not at the bedside.</p>

<p>Little attentions in the way of ornamentation, and
thoughtfulness as to an invalid's meal, are deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
appreciated. They show that an effort has been made
to please, and to many sick ones the feeling that they
are a constant care to those about them is a very oppressive
one. It should be the pleasure of a good
nurse to dispel such thoughts. It is the duty of every
nurse to do so.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Variety, Intervals of Feeding</span></h3>

<p>Variety for those who are sick (after they are out
of danger, and waiting for strength to return) is just
as necessary as for those who are well, and for the
same reason&mdash;that is, to furnish the body with all
those substances required for perfect nutrition. Many
think that because a person is ill, or an invalid, he
must be denied all things that are good, and fed
upon such dishes as well persons generally abhor, like
water gruel, thin oyster stews, and half-cooked corn-starch
pudding.</p>

<p>It is curious how such an idea should have been
lodged in the mind, but it is probably a relic of the
old treatment in the days before antiseptic surgery
and the modern practice of medicine. Now, as soon
as a patient is out of danger, careful feeding with
a variety of wholesome, perfectly cooked, nutritious
food&mdash;of course, wisely administered as to quantity&mdash;is
an essential part of the treatment, and constitutes
nearly the whole cure in some forms of disease of the
nervous system.</p>

<p>The body, depleted and exhausted by long-continued
sickness, is without resources, and must draw
from food (and, of course, air) all those substances
needed for repair and the restoration of bodily vigor.
To insure this, different kinds of food are required,
for no single one, not even milk, contains everything
needed.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Fruits of various kinds, green salads and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
vegetables, fish, beef, and mutton should be used, as
well as milk, eggs, chicken, and toast.</p>

<p>Ease in serving the sick is an accomplishment in a
nurse, and a certain amount of <em>seeming</em> indifference
is an advisable quality to cultivate. It is a good plan
to take every <em>possible care</em> in preparing a meal for a
sick person, and then to appear not to notice whether
he eats; for sometimes sensitive people, in their desire
not to disappoint, or in their endeavors to please, will
eat when they do not care for food.</p>

<p>Endeavor to remember individual tastes, and try
to gratify them; always do so when it is in your
power, for these individual preferences are often true
instincts of the individual nature striving to secure
that which is best for it. If a man asks for the
second joint of a fowl, don't take to him a cut from
the breast, even though <em>you</em> may think it the choicest
portion.</p>

<p>Food should be given at <em>regular intervals</em>. If a
patient is very ill, the rule is to administer nourishment
in small quantities and often. Sometimes a
patient is too feeble to help himself to food, and then
he must be fed by the nurse. When such is the case,
she should be extremely careful, no matter what the
pressure of other work may be, not to hurry him.
Give him plenty of time,&mdash;first, that the food may remain
in the mouth long enough to be mixed with the
saliva, for saliva is one of the digestive juices; and
second, so that it may be thoroughly masticated and
broken; otherwise it will be thrown into the stomach
in large masses, and may not digest at all.</p>

<p>The <em>quantity</em> of food given will always depend
upon the condition of the person, and will consequently
vary for each individual. Give rather <em>too
little</em> than too much, with, of course, the understanding
that there is always an abundance to be had. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
little is often a challenge, especially to one of delicate
appetite; a large quantity is always vulgar. It is
much better to carry a second portion to one who
needs it than to offer too much at first.</p>

<p>No exact and definite directions can be given for
the serving of special dishes, for a nurse's resources
in the way of china, etc., are so uncertain; but a few
hints in regard to some principles that, no matter
what the circumstances are, never change may be
found of service.</p>

<p>For instance, water, lemonade, milk, milk-punch,
and all other cold drinks are most healthful when
<em>cool</em>, not ice-cold. Ice-cold water, ice-cold milk, and
all chilled drinks are <em>always forbidden</em> for both sick
and well, except in fevers, in extremely hot weather,
and in unusual cases, when only a few spoons of
liquid are taken. Even in these cases it is a question
whether <em>cool</em> liquids would not do as well. We all
know the danger of taking a large quantity of ice-cold
drink when overheated. Even death has frequently
resulted from it.</p>

<p>Serve tea, coffee, cocoa, bouillon, broth, gruel, and
all hot drinks in cups which are <em>hot</em>, not lukewarm.
Soup as a part of a meal should be served in a covered
silver dish when practicable, for silver may be
made very hot, and no other is so pretty. In lieu of
silver use a covered china dish, or a bouillon-cup
made hot in an oven beforehand. Remember that
the <em>warmth</em> of all these foods is one of their valuable
qualities.</p>

<p>Beef-juice and beef-tea may be offered in a red
wine-glass, to conceal the color, which is sometimes at
first unpleasant to those unaccustomed to the use of
rare beef; but the taste of these is so acceptable and
savory that, after taking a few spoons, the objection
vanishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Cups and tumblers ought not to be filled to more
than within a half inch of the top. The best argument
for this custom is, that it is considered good
form; but there is a good reason back of it, as is the
case in most other established customs. If a cup be
filled to the brim it cannot be moved without spilling
the liquid over the outside; this occasions wiping,
which it is especially difficult to do, and waste of a
certain portion of the contents; then it is not easy
to drink from a cup so filled.</p>

<p>Fruits, such as oranges, grapes, peaches, and tomatoes,
should be served cool, but not cold or chilled.
The ideal way to eat fruits is without artificial cooling.
A peach is never so delicious as at the moment it
is gathered from the tree, just ripe, and tomatoes
have the finest flavor eaten directly off the vines; but
it is seldom that these fruits or others can be so obtained,
and we, knowing that fruits do not keep well
except in cool places, are apt to associate a certain
degree of coolness with them. The objection to serving
fruits very cold is that, besides the fact that they
are not as readily digested so, their delicate flavor
is lost, for the cold contracts the sensitive papillæ of
the tongue, and thus the power of tasting is temporarily
deadened.</p>

<p>Oranges, peaches, and plums may be used uncooked,
as they are extremely easy of digestion so, and also
grapes, unless there is objection to the seeds, in
which case they should be cooked, and the seeds
strained out. Apples and pears are safer cooked; tomatoes
may be eaten either way.</p>

<p>Transparent jellies are pretty served in glass
dishes, and ice-cream, sherbets, and ices in china
saucers, or ice-cream dishes of pink, or other delicately
warm colors. Ice-cream, uncolored, in shell
pink, is much more attractive than it is in cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
mauve or green. Water-ices, which usually have
color of their own, may be served in dishes to match it.
Raspberry or strawberry ice is lovely in dull rich red;
apricot ice in yellow&mdash;that is, a certain shade of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écru</span>
which harmonizes with the color of the fruit&mdash;and
pineapple and lemon ice in Dresden ware are very
pretty.</p>

<p>Eggs should be opened into a hot, though not very
hot, egg-glass. It is the proper thing to do so even
when a patient is well enough to open them for himself,
for, although the supply may have been obtained
from the very best sources, there is always the risk
that some of the eggs may be old, too old to be good.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Oysters in the half-shell are served simply with salt,
pepper, and lemon-juice, or horse-radish. A quarter
or a half of a lemon is placed on the oyster-plate with
the oysters, and after the salt and pepper are sprinkled
on a few drops of lemon-juice are squeezed over each
oyster, or a bit of horse-radish is placed on each.</p>

<p>Broiled oysters may be served with a sauce of
melted butter, seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon-juice
or vinegar.</p>

<p>Toast is particularly acceptable with nearly all
kinds of cooked oysters, and fancy shapes, such as
tiny rounds, squares, and points, are excellent with
stews, soups, and roasts, instead of crackers.</p>

<p>Dry toast ought to be eaten directly off the toaster,
and, except in serious illness, butter may be given
with it. Orange, gooseberry, raspberry, and other
marmalades, currant, apple, and grape jellies, and
baked sweet apples or apple-sauce, are excellent with
either dry or water toast. Cooked apples in any
form are delicious with milk and cream toasts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>
<p>It is the fashion just now to serve junket, slip,
soft custard, lemon cream, tapioca cream, and similar
delicate desserts in cups and saucers, not glasses.
The quainter the pattern of the china, the prettier
the effect.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">A Plan for the Preparation of an Invalid's Breakfast</span></h3>

<p>A plan for a breakfast, to consist of a peach, rolled
wheat porridge, beefsteak, baked potato, coffee, and
toast:</p>

<p>(1) Put the porridge, which should have been
cooked the day before, on the fire to heat, and the
potato into the oven to bake.</p>

<p>(2) Set some water to boil for the coffee, and the
milk to heat to serve with it.</p>

<p>(3) Trim the steak, which should be a small piece
an inch thick, an inch and a half wide, and three or
four inches long; cut the bread, and make a butter-ball
by rolling a bit of butter between two spatters
made for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>(4) Set a plate, cup and saucer, and dishes for serving
the food, in the warming-oven to heat.</p>

<p>(5) Arrange the tray with a fresh napkin, knife,
fork, spoons, salt and pepper, fine granulated sugar
and cold cream for the porridge, and some lumps of
loaf sugar for the coffee.</p>

<p>(6) Fifteen minutes before the potato is done make
the coffee, and ten minutes later broil the steak; in
the interim pare the peach, laying it open from the
stone, and toast the bread.</p>

<p>Now, if calculation as to the time has been well
made, everything will be ready&mdash;the potato baked,
the porridge steaming, the coffee cooked, and the
steak and toast waiting in the oven.</p>

<p>(7) Serve the fruit on a tiny fruit-plate, the porridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
in a hot saucer, and the coffee, together. When
the fruit and porridge are finished, offer the potato,
wrapped in a doily to keep it warm, the steak in a
hot covered silver dish, and the toast on an individual
bread-plate. Or all may be served together when
for any reason it seems best to do so: for instance, if
the tray has to be carried a long distance, or up many
flights of stairs.</p>

<p>The above arrangement is simply beginning with
the things which require the longest time, and then
taking each in such order that all shall be finished at
the same moment.</p>

<p>By understanding the length of time required for
each dish, there need be no hurrying, nor will anything
be cooked too soon.</p>

<p>Dinner should be planned in the same way, and
also supper. Even when there is not much cooking to
be done the same idea prevails&mdash;that is, to begin with
whatever requires the longest time, and to do last
those dishes which spoil by standing; in other words,
to be systematic, (1) because your meal is in better
condition when so done, and (2) because it is easier
for yourself. There then will be neither hurry nor
worry, and work which ends with a satisfactory
result is always a pleasure.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FEEDING" id="THE_FEEDING"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN</a></h2>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Ways in which a Child may be Supplied with Food</span></h3>

<p>There are three ways in which a child may be supplied
with food during its infancy: by its mother;
by a substitute for its mother&mdash;a wet nurse; and by
artificial feeding. This chapter will treat only of the
latter method.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Artificial Feeding</span></h3>

<p>The child is fortunate whose mother can supply it
with a sufficient quantity of wholesome milk. There
is nothing more to be desired for it during the first
ten or twelve months of its life. But often a mother,
for one reason or another, is not able to nurse her
child, and other means of feeding must be sought.
In such cases, among the wealthier classes, a wet
nurse is sometimes employed; but with the majority
of people there is no alternative except artificial feeding.
When this has been decided upon, the question
naturally arises as to what shall be the best substitute
for the natural nourishment of the child&mdash;mother's

    <h3><span class="hidden">Buying, Care, and Sterilization of Cow's Milk</span></h3>

<p>Cow's milk varies considerably in nutritive properties,
and for the growing infant who receives no other
food it is extremely important that it be of the first
quality. It should be tested in every possible way to
enable one to form a correct estimate of its value,
and unless unquestionably good should be rejected.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
When fresh from the cow, not more than two hours
old, and of superior quality, it need not be sterilized,
but should be put into perfectly cleansed and sterile
vessels,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and kept in an ice-box, or refrigerator, at a
temperature of 50° to 60° Fahr.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>When obliged to buy the ordinary milk of commerce,
select if possible that which is put up in glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
jars. There are farmers who do this. Each jar is
sealed, marked with the owner's name and address,
and the date of sending. Such milk does not become
contaminated with bad air in transit, cannot be tampered
with by middlemen, and must be free from
dirt, as it would show through the glass; each customer
gets exactly a quart, with all the cream that
belongs to it; moreover, the owner, having attached
his name, has thus put his reputation at stake, and
is not likely to sell inferior milk. When this is not
practicable, search for the best and cleanest dairy, and
see that the milk is delivered as soon as possible after
being received at the dairy. Milk should not be
bought from small stores.</p>

<p>The best milk comes from cows that have good
pasturage, with clean running water, and that are fed
in winter on dry fodder and grain, and not on ensilage
and brewery waste.</p>

<p>According to the reports of the American Public
Health Association, <em>one fifth</em> of all the deaths among
infants may be traced to the milk supply, and there
is no doubt that most of the sickness of bottle-fed
children, during the summer months, is directly due
to the unhealthy condition of their food.</p>

<p>It then becomes the imperative duty of every mother,
nurse, or other person who has the care of children, to
learn, if she does not already know, the simpler tests
for milk, and something of the philosophy of the feeding
of her charge.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> When such knowledge is more
general, and women are able to determine intelligently
the quality of the milk which is offered them, then
will milk-dealers be forced to cease mixing, adulterating,
and otherwise tampering with the milk, which,
as a general thing, is sold at the farms in excellent
condition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>The first object is to secure a good quality of milk;
then comes the consideration of how it shall be prepared:
this must be in such manner as shall render it
as nearly like human milk, in composition and digestibility,
as possible.</p>

<p>Comparison of the tables just given shows that cow's
milk contains more nitrogenous matter and salts, and
less sugar, than human milk.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> By diluting with water
to reduce the protein and salts, and adding sugar and
a little cream, the proportions of these different substances
may be made to approximate those in mother's
milk. In both the sugar is the same&mdash;lactose, or
milk-sugar; the fats are also much alike in each; but
the albuminous matter of cow's milk differs somewhat
from that of human milk, particularly in the way in
which it coagulates in the presence of acids. Human
milk forms into small, light, feathery curds; cow's
milk into large, compact, not so easily digested
masses. It is necessary, therefore, to seek the means
for preventing the coagulation of milk in large curds
in the stomach of the child&mdash;in other words, to so
treat cow's milk that it shall coagulate more like
human milk. This may be done in two ways:</p>

<p>(1) By mixing into the milk some substance which
shall separate the particles of albumen from each
other, and so cause it to form into smaller masses.</p>

<p>(2) By partial predigestion.</p>

<p>To accomplish the first, it is necessary to use some
diluting substance of a harmless nature; if it be nutritious,
so much the better. For this, Mellin's food,
barley-water, veal broth, lime-water, and gelatin are
recommended.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Mellin's Food and other Attenuants</span></h3>

<p>Mellin's food is a partially predigested grain, in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
a condition that it can be assimilated by the infant;
barley-water is valuable for its potash salts, in which
cow's milk is deficient, and which the growing babe
needs; veal broth is rich in lime; and lime-water
neutralizes the acid of the gastric juice, so that milk
is not acted upon so strongly, and consequently forms
into a lighter curd.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Predigestion</span></h3>

<p>The second method is that of partial predigestion,
and is accomplished by the use of peptonizing agents,
among which Fairchild's peptogenic milk-powder is
good (directions for its use will be given later). On
account of the expense of these preparations it is not
probable that they will come into general use, except
in cases of sickness.</p>

<p>It is therefore evident that dependence must be
placed almost entirely upon attenuants to render the
casein of cow's milk more easily digestible. Probably
for this Mellin's food is as good, if not better, than
any other of the recommended preparations. It is not
injurious, is nutritious in itself, and is a good diluting
agent, causing milk to form into looser curds than
it would otherwise do, and it contains sufficient sugar
to require no further addition of this substance.</p>

<p>Now arises the question whether milk shall be
sterilized for infants' feeding. The weight of evidence
seems to be as follows: if it is possible to see
the conditions under which the cows live, and to <em>know</em>
that they are unquestionably good, that the animals
are in perfect health, that the milk is drawn from
cleansed udders into cleansed vessels by clean hands,
kept in a cool place, and used fresh, then it is probably
wise not to sterilize it. All milk otherwise
obtained should be made sterile before using, and
as soon as possible after milking. Looking to the
standard&mdash;human milk&mdash;there are no organisms in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
it. That alone is sufficient reason why cow's milk
should be freed from them.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Again, most bottle-fed children do well during the
cold weather of autumn and winter; in summer the
mortality is very great among them, especially in
the poorer districts of large cities. It is well known
that the chances for life with children nourished by
mother's milk are greater than with those artificially
fed. Why should this be? There is no doubt that it
is owing to the presence in cow's milk of extraneous
substances, the products of bacterial growth&mdash;products
which are often absolute poisons; and it is
highly probable that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cholera infantum</span>, in a vast majority
of cases, may be traced to the action of such
poisons.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Bacterial Poisins in Milk</span></h3>

<p>Under favorable conditions of temperature, such as
prevail in the warm months of summer and early
autumn, micro-organisms grow with almost incomprehensible
rapidity in any substance which is suitable
food for them. Milk is such a substance; and, as
bacteria multiply with wonderful rapidity, millions
forming in a few hours in every thimbleful,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> it is
perfectly evident that they must produce something.
This something may or may not be of a harmful nature,
depending upon what species of organism produces
it. I have no evidence at hand to show what is
the nature of the product of any one organism which
finds a home in milk; but there are instances on
record where the nature of the product of certain bacteria
is known: for example, the diphtheria bacillus.
This little rod, growing upon the outside of the tonsils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in the human throat, produces a most virulent
poison, which, taken up by the circulation, pervades
the whole body, and often so enfeebles its functions
as to destroy it.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Reasoning from analogy, it is not impossible to
suppose that other organisms may produce substances
of a similar character, poisonous in their effects, and
which, when taken into the alimentary canal, may
produce very grave digestive disorders.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Further, bacteria, by their multiplication, use some
of the constituents of milk for their food, thus changing
its composition. It is very important to prevent
this growth, or, in case it has begun, to check it before
it has rendered the milk unwholesome food. Hence
the necessity of sterilizing <em>immediately</em> all milk which
is not received directly from the cow. Besides, cows
are often infected with tuberculosis, foot-and-mouth
disease, splenic fever, pneumonia, and other dangerous
disorders. Their milk may be a direct cause of
infection. When it is sterilized there is less danger
from it; but even then it is not, of course, a wholesome
food, because of the poisons which may be produced
in the animal during the progress of the disease, and
because a sick and weakened cow cannot give wholesome
milk.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In many cities, through the influence of children's
hospitals and sanitariums, the knowledge and methods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of sterilizing milk for infants' food are gradually
spreading.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Apparatus for Sterilizing Milk</span></h3>

<p>Circular wire frames, made something like casters,
and fitted with eight bottles, each holding enough
milk for one feeding, may be bought for the purpose
of sterilizing at almost any pharmacy. The frame is
to be set in a kettle with water in the bottom, which
on boiling produces steam, the heat of which does
the sterilizing.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This is an easy method. Another
good way is to sterilize at a lower temperature for a
longer time, as less change is produced in the constituents
of the milk by the lower degree of heat.
This may be easily done by immersing the bottles in
water at 190° Fahr., and maintaining that temperature
for an hour.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Care of Feeding-Bottles</span></h3>

<p><b>Care of Feeding-bottles.</b> Great care must be taken
in cleansing feeding-bottles. When they can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
washed immediately after using, it is easy to make
them perfectly clean; but when this is impracticable
they should be put to soak in <em>cold</em> water, then washed
with hot soap-suds, and last boiled for ten minutes in
clear water. If flecks dry on the inside, put a teaspoon
of rice, or coarse salt, into the bottle with a little
water, and shake well until all is removed. Never
use shot: it might cause lead poisoning.</p>

<p>Plain rubber nipples alone should be used, never
the tube attachment. The nipples should be washed
clean and dried after each nursing. Before again
using the nipple it should be put into boiling water
for ten minutes, and only the rim of it should be
touched in handling. The nipple should never be put
into the mouth of another person to test the milk.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Condensed Milk</span></h3>

<p><b>Condensed Milk.</b> When a large percentage of the
water of milk is evaporated, and sugar added, a thick
syrup is formed, known as condensed milk.</p>

<p>It is made extensively in Switzerland and America.
When sealed air-tight in cans it will keep indefinitely.</p>

<p>Its average composition&mdash;a mean of 41 analyses
by Prof. Leeds&mdash;is as follows:</p>

<div class="center fs80">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the additional sugar it is impossible to
dilute it so that the protein and sugar shall approach
the standard of human milk.</p>

<p>Children fed with it are plump, but have soft flesh;
they are large, but not strong, and lack the power of
endurance and resistance to disease. Their teeth
come late, and they are very likely to have rickets.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
This is enough to indicate that it is not a proper
food upon which to feed a child exclusively.</p>

<p>Condensed milk is valuable in emergencies or in
traveling, and may also be used occasionally when for
any reason the milk supply fails. It has the advantage
of being free from ferments and easily kept.</p>

<p>There are physicians who recommend the use of
condensed milk, and no doubt, compared with the
germ-laden, watery fluid called milk, obtainable in
the poorer sections of large cities, it is infinitely better.
It should always be diluted with at least ten
times its bulk of water.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Preserved Milk</span></h3>

<p><b>Preserved Milk.</b> Preserved milk is milk which has
been condensed and canned without the addition of
sugar. It would be a valuable food for children
were it not that it is expensive, and will keep but a
few hours after the can is opened. By sterilizing it in
flasks with narrow necks, plugged with cotton, it may
be kept as other milk is for an indefinite time. As
soon as the can is opened, the contents should be
poured into a glass or earthen vessel, for, on exposure
of the milk to the air, chemical action takes place
with the tin.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Farinaceous Foods</span></h3>

<p><b>Farinaceous Foods.</b> There are many farinaceous
forms of food prepared for the use of infants and
children. Probably the most valuable of them are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
those made according to the Liebig process. The
starch of the grain from which such foods are prepared
is, in the process of manufacture, changed into
soluble dextrine, or sugar (glucose), by the action of
the diastase of malt: the very thing which an infant
cannot do.</p>

<p>When we consider that the digestion of starch in
the alimentary canal consists of this change into
glucose, and that it is effected principally by the
saliva and the pancreatic juice, the significance of
the value of such foods will be seen.</p>

<p>It is also well to bear in mind that neither of these
functions (the secretion of saliva and pancreatic juice)
is developed in an infant until it enters the third
month of its life, and then but very imperfectly.
That alone shows the necessity of <em>excluding all starch</em>
from its food up to that age.</p>

<p>Mellin's food and malted milk are prepared according
to the Liebig process. In them the starch has
been converted into soluble matter by the action of
the ferment of malt. It is really a partial predigestion.
Mellin's food does not contain milk.</p>

<p>The following analysis of Mellin's food is one made
by Professor Fresenius, of Wiesbaden, Germany:</p>

<p>This analysis shows that Mellin's food bears comparison
with milk. It is easily digested, and as an
<em>attenuant</em> for milk may be used without harm during
the early months of life, but it should not be used
to the exclusion of milk for more than a few days at
a time, and then only when milk is not retained by
the stomach.</p>

<p>Later it is doubtless a valuable addition to the regular
daily food of the child.</p>

<p>Malted milk is made from selected grain and desiccated
or dried milk. To prepare it for the infant
it needs only the addition of water. It is probably
one of the best substitutes for milk, but should not
be used for any length of time when it is possible to
get good milk.</p>

<p>The starch of grains may be converted into dextrine
and glucose by the action of heat as well as by
the action of diastase, so that when flour is subjected
to a certain temperature, and for a certain time, this
change is produced.</p>

<p>Nestlé's food, Imperial Granum, Ridge's food, and
some others are made very carefully from selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
wheat by this process. Nestlé's food contains dried
milk.</p>

<p>These foods are all valuable when made into gruel
or porridge, but should be used very sparingly under
the age of twelve months, and then only as attenuants
for milk, <em>not as substitutes</em> for it.</p>

<p>Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, editor of "Domestic Hygiene
of the Child," by Uffelmann (a translation), in
speaking of the value of the various preparations of
infants' food on the market, says: "There is not the
slightest reason to prefer them to milk or its preparations,
except that the latter requires more care; and
for any intelligent and affectionate mother this reason
is quite insufficient.... During the first year
the baby is building up tissues and organs that are
to last him throughout life; and these will work well
or ill according to the degree of perfection and precision
of structure which they attain at the beginning.
And this depends to an immense extent upon
the suitability of the food, not only to be digested,
but to be absorbed, and then to be assimilated and
organized.</p>

<p>"So mysterious are the properties of the molecules
of albumen and fat, when once they have been thrown
into the whirl of the living organism, that we must
strive to deviate as little as possible from the exact
forms given to us in nature, if only because we do
not know what remote effects might result from the
deviations. If nature provides the albumen of milk
and a living fluid, we cannot expect the same results
from any other albumen, or from long dead organic
matter, as condensed milk."</p>

<p>The farinaceous foods have value, but they cannot
replace good milk, which should be almost the sole
food of the child to at least the age of ten months,
and the principal nutrient to the age of two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>When a baby is nursed, and its mother has an
abundance of milk, it takes nothing else during the
first ten or twelve months of life. When a baby is
artificially fed, this fact should be borne in mind.
The important thing is to attain as nearly as possible
to the standard that nature has set.</p>

<p>Biedert's cream mixture and the whey mixture are
valuable for young infants and those which for any
reason do not thrive on milk.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Amount of Food for Each Meal</span></h3>

<p><b>Amount for Each Meal.</b> A child is nourished, not by
what it swallows, but by what it digests. Giving
too much or too concentrated milk is very unwise,
for the delicate system cannot manage it, and too
frequently the meal becomes a source of pain rather
than of strength. Each individual babe will require
a little different treatment in this respect from
every other.</p>

<p>In general, for the first six weeks from two to four
tablespoons at a feeding may be given; from that age
to six months, from four to eight tablespoons, gradually
increasing the amount to twelve tablespoons at
one year.</p>

<p><b>Dilution.</b> Cow's milk is more easily digested when
diluted with water, and we are more likely to dilute
too little than too much. The amount of water used
should vary with the age and strength of digestion
of the child. As a rule the new-born infant should
have two parts water to one of milk; at four months
equal parts of milk and water; at ten months one
part water and two parts milk. When digestion is
particularly feeble, it may be necessary to dilute milk
with six or eight times its bulk of water.</p>

<p><b>Manner of Giving.</b> It is best to give milk from a
bottle so constructed that suction is necessary, for it
induces the flow of the digestive juices. Use the
plain rubber nipple; those with tube attachments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which extend into the bottle are to be avoided, on account
of the difficulty of making them perfectly clean
inside. Cultures from these tubes always give large
numbers of bacteria, as do also those made from the
nipples, unless they are boiled.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Temperature of Food, and Intervals of Feeding</span></h3>

<p>The <em>intervals</em> of feeding will vary somewhat with
the age of the child. Once in two or two and a half
hours during the day for the first six months, and
every three hours from the sixth to the twelfth month,
is the general rule.</p>

<p>The <em>temperature</em> of the meal should be 100° Fahr.</p>

<p>A babe needs less variety in its food than older
children, and they in turn require less than grown
persons; but both must have a certain proportion of
the five essential food principles.</p>

<p>There is an impression in the minds of many that
children should not have fat. This has perhaps
sprung from the fact that mother's milk has a watery,
thin appearance. It seems not rich; nevertheless it
has a due proportion of fat, and it is extremely important
that this be maintained when cow's milk is
diluted, for this cream is the best addition.</p>

<p>Fat is needed not only for the growth of brain and
nerves, which is very rapid in children, but also for
the perfect formation of other tissues.</p>

<p>The following table is that given by Dr. Louis
Starr as a guide for feeding:</p>

<p>If it is desirable to make at once a sufficient quantity
of Biedert's cream mixture for several feedings,
the above rule multiplied by eight will furnish enough
for eight bottles, and is as follows: one cup of cream,
three cups of boiling water, and one tablespoon of
milk-sugar. Mix all together; put the mixture in
equal portions into eight feeding-bottles, and plug
each with cotton. Either sterilize it or put it immediately
on ice to keep.</p>

<h4>After the First Week, and Until the Sixth Week</h4>

<p>Use either the cream mixture, the whey mixture, or
the following:</p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of cow's milk.<br />
&nbsp;4 Tablespoons of water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of Mellin's food.<br />
⅓ Teaspoon of milk-sugar.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<h4>From the Sixth Week to the Sixth Month</h4>

<p>Water and milk in equal quantities, with a little
cream and milk-sugar, and some attenuant, such as
Mellin's food or barley jelly.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="recipe">
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of cow's milk.<br />
&nbsp;2 Tablespoons of water.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of cream.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a><br />
&nbsp;1 Teaspoon of Mellin's food.<br />
⅜ Teaspoon of sugar.<br />
</div>

<p>The above proportion to be maintained, but the
amount to be varied according to the age of the babe.</p>

<p>If at any time this disagrees, use instead Biedert's
cream mixture or the whey mixture. When both of
these fail it may be necessary to peptonize the food.</p>

<p><em>To peptonize milk</em>:</p>

<div class="recipe">
<span class="fs90 bold pad6">No. 1</span><br />
2 Tablespoons of milk.<br />
2 Tablespoons of water.<br />
1 Tablespoon of cream.<br />
1 Small measure of peptogenic milk powder.<br />
</div>

<p>Put all into a clean porcelain-lined saucepan and
heat it, stirring slowly until the mixture boils: this
should not require more than ten minutes.</p>

<p class="pfs90 bold">No. 2</p>

<p>A special preparation for sick or feeble infants, or
those suffering from indigestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<div class="recipe15">
2 Tablespoons of milk.<br />
2 Tablespoons of water.<br />
1 Tablespoon of cream.<br />
1 Small measure of peptogenic milk powder.<br />
</div>

<p>Put all into a bottle, shake it well, place it in a
bath or kettle of hot water of a temperature of 115°
Fahr. (so hot that the hand cannot be borne in it
long without discomfort), and keep it at that temperature
for exactly thirty minutes; then pour it into
a saucepan, and heat quickly to the boiling point.
By this method a very thorough predigestion takes
place. The process should be stopped before the bitter
taste is developed.</p>

<h4>From the Sixth to the Tenth Month</h4>

<p>Increase the proportion of milk and of Mellin's food,
or other attenuant used.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="recipe">

&nbsp;3 Tablespoons of water.<br />
&nbsp;1½ Teaspoons of cream.<br />
&nbsp;1 Tablespoon of Mellin's food.<br />
½ Teaspoon of milk-sugar.<br />
</div>

<p>Boil the water, then add the milk, Mellin's food,
cream, and sugar, or put all together in a feeding-bottle,
place in a kettle of water heated to 190° Fahr.,
and keep it at that temperature for one hour.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This
amount is only a general rule, and may, of course,
be varied according to the age and individual need of
the child. The <em>proportion</em> of the ingredients should,
however, not be changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<h4>From the Tenth to the Twelfth Month</h4>

<div class="recipe">
6 Tablespoons of cow's milk.<br />
3 Tablespoons of water.<br />
1½ Tablespoons of cream.<br />
1 or 2 Tablespoons of Mellin's food.<br />
1 Teaspoon of milk-sugar.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><br />
</div>

<p><em>Mellin's Food with Condensed Milk.</em> Although, as
has been previously stated, condensed milk is not a
proper food for children, there are times when it may
be necessary to use it: for instance, in traveling, or
when the daily supply of milk for any reason fails.</p>

<p>The usual mixture of condensed milk given to babies
is one part of milk to twelve parts of water, the
analysis<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of which shows the fat and casein to be in
too small proportions. If more condensed milk be
added, the sugar will be increased too much; but by
increasing the water, and using Mellin's food and
cream, a very good mixture may be obtained. The
following is recommended:</p>

<div class="recipe">
1 Teaspoon condensed milk.<br />
1 Tablespoon of Mellin's food.<br />
8 Tablespoons of water (1 cup).<br />
1 Teaspoon of cream.<br />
</div>

<p>Boil the water, then add the condensed milk, Mellin's
food, and cream in the order in which they are
mentioned, stirring until all is dissolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing should be used during the first twelve
months except liquid food, and that must not be of
too great density.</p>

<p>Avoid any food which contains cellulose, or starch
as such.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Cellulose is but imperfectly if at all digested
by grown persons; and starch, not being a natural
kind of nourishment for an infant, is extremely liable
to ferment and cause serious digestive disturbances.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that, although the chief
function of a babe is to eat, sleep, and grow, its
stomach cannot work all the time, and, consequently,
the wise plan is to feed it only at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The best proof that a child is doing well is increase
of weight, a healthy appearance, and lack of fretfulness.
Sometimes, when restless, it is only a drink of
water that it needs, as children suffer much from thirst
in warm weather.</p>

<h4>From the Twelfth to the Eighteenth Month</h4>

<p>Continue with milk, <em>undiluted</em> with water, as the
principal food. Use with it Mellin's food as before,
Nestlé's food, Ridge's food, Imperial Granum, oatmeal
porridge <em>strained</em>, soft custard, soft-cooked eggs,
cocoa<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> cooked in water, with milk added or cooked in
milk, and cracker-crumbs boiled in water, with milk
added.</p>

<h4>After Eighteen Months</h4>

<p>The same diet as for the previous six months, with
the addition of scraped or pounded chicken, mutton,
or beef; mashed baked potatoes with beef-juice poured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
over; toasted bread or toasted crackers rolled into
crumbs, and soaked in milk or broth; junket, and
plain, simple puddings, such as cream-of-rice, tapioca,
and arrowroot.</p>

<p>A diet similar to this should be the chief food to
the seventh year. It may be varied by farina, wheat-germ,
and other grain mushes, dried rusk and milk,
or Zwieback<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and milk, sponge cake with cream or
milk, snow-pudding, and other wholesome and delicate
desserts, and cooked fruits.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Foods to be Avoided</span></h3>

<p><b>Foods to be Carefully Avoided.</b> Veal, pork in any
form except bacon,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> highly seasoned stews, curries,
canned meats or dried meats in any form, baked
beans, fruit cake, also all cakes or gingerbread made
with so-called "cooking-butter" or with common lard,
raw fruits, lobsters and crabs, new potatoes, berries,
and cabbage.</p>

<h2><a name="DISTRICT_NURSING" id="DISTRICT_NURSING"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">DISTRICT NURSING</a></h2>

<p>In England and in some parts of America district
nursing, or nursing among the very poor of certain
sections of a city, is an established part of a nurse's
work. Her duties are to go from house to house
among the sick, to administer medicine and food,
and to make the surroundings of her patient comfortable.</p>

<p>There is no way in which one may reach the hearts
and sympathies of the poor so quickly as by helping
them to, or showing them how to do for themselves,
those things which they think they need.</p>

<p>Their first consideration is for the immediate necessities
of life&mdash;food, clothing, and shelter. Their
days are spent in a struggle with the world for these&mdash;too
often an unequal struggle, in which the world
conquers. A nurse, or any other person who can gain
admission to their homes and sympathies, may help
them in many ways as no other can. Great good
may be done by teaching them economical and simple
methods of preparing their food, which as a general
thing is cooked both badly and wastefully.</p>

<p>A nurse doing district nursing, besides administering
medicine and making her patient generally
comfortable, will inevitably and naturally turn to
the preparation of some form of nourishment for
him. If she can make it acceptably with the materials
and cooking utensils at hand, or is able to ask
for that which is within the means of the family, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to direct the buying of it, she will add greatly to the
comfort of the household.</p>

<p>The object of this chapter is not, however, to deal
with cooking for the sick. That will be left entirely
to the judgment of the nurse, who is supposed to
have studied the subject as a part of her training.
But it has occurred to the author that a nurse doing
district nursing would often find the opportunity to
help the <em>families</em> of her patients, and that often such
help would need to be given in order to prevent actual
suffering. Especially would this be true if it were
the mother of a family who was ill, and there was no
one to prepare food for the father and children, who
must be fed. Usually there is a child, either boy or
girl, who is old enough to learn if there is some one
to teach.</p>

<p>The following pages have been written for the purpose
of suggesting, to such nurses as are disposed to
do good in this way, some easily made and economical
dishes which are really both palatable and nutritious.
A few directions about building a fire, washing dishes,
sweeping, etc., will be given, and then some bills of
fare with recipes adapted for the use of people of
small means, and taken for the most part from the
Lomb Prize Essay by Mary H. Abel, entitled "Practical,
Sanitary, and Economic Cooking," and published
by the American Public Health Association, 1890.</p>

<p>Permission to use these recipes has been graciously
granted by Mrs. Abel, and the American Public
Health Association, through Mr. Lomb.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">To make a Fire</span></h3>

<p><b>To Make a Fire.</b> First, clear the stove of ashes and
cinders, then put in wood-shavings, or twisted newspaper;
over this foundation lay small pieces of wood,
crossed, so as to leave air-spaces for draft, then larger
pieces of wood, and lastly two or three fire-shovels
of coal. Light the kindling from the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
grate, and let it burn for a while before putting on
more coal; remember that it is the heat from the
burning wood which ignites the coal, and if it does
not burn it is because there is not wood enough to
produce sufficient heat to start the union between the
combustible part of the coal&mdash;carbon chiefly&mdash;and
the oxygen of the air. Add coal a little at a time,
thus keeping a fresh fire.</p>

<p>After the fire is well started regulate the dampers
often, to economize as much as possible the consumption
of coal. Keep them partially or wholly closed,
unless a hot fire is needed for some purpose. The
cinders left from an old fire should be sifted and re-burned.
Many dollars' worth of coal may be saved
in a year by giving attention to the drafts of a stove.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">To Wash Dishes</span></h3>

<p><b>To Wash Dishes.</b> Mixing-bowls, double boilers, and
all dishes which for any reason have food clinging to
them, should be put to soak in cold water as soon as
used. If this has not been done, attend to it before
making other arrangements for washing the dishes.
See then that the dish-pan or tub, dish-cloths, and
sink are perfectly clean; if not, make them so with
hot water and soap. Wash the dishes in hot soapy
water, not hot water alone, even if they are not
greasy, and rinse them in a pan of clear hot water.
Take glassware, silver, and china first, then steel
knives and forks, granite-ware, kettles, tins, etc.
When the dishes are finished, wash thoroughly and
dry, or put to dry, both the wiping-towels and the
dish-cloths; unless they are white, clean, and sweet
when done, boil them in clear soapy water until they
become so, changing it frequently if it looks dark.</p>

    <h3><span class="hidden">Sweeping and Dusting</span></h3>

<p><b>Sweeping and Dusting.</b> Sweep slowly and carefully,
holding the broom close to the floor, so that the dust
shall not be thrown into the air. <em>Burn the dirt</em>; never
allow it to be thrown into a box or into the coal-hod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Dusting should be done with a damp cloth, wiping
up the dust, not brushing it into the air, from which
it will settle upon some other object. When you have
finished, wash the duster and hang it to dry. Never
use a feather duster. With it one simply brushes the
dust from one place only to have it settle in another.</p>

<p class="p1x" />
<h3>BILLS OF FARE</h3>

<p>Mrs. Abel says, in her chapter headed "Bills of
Fare": "The following bills of fare are made out for
a family of six persons, consisting of a workingman,
two women, and three children between the ages of
six and fifteen.</p>

<p>"The amount of food, and the proportion in which
the great food principles are represented, approximate
to that which is demanded by standard dietaries for
such a family....</p>

<p>"To keep us in health and in working order, we
ought to have a certain amount of what is best furnished
by meat, eggs, milk, and other animal products,
and we must also have fats, as well as what is given
us in grains and vegetables." The following bills of
fare are made up with this object in view:</p>

<p>For a family of six; average price, seventy-eight
cents per day, or thirteen cents per person.</p>

the bread in the water for a few minutes. Fry the
onion, sliced, in the fat, and add it to the soup, with
the salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Or, use milk instead of water, and toasted or fried
bread. Boil slowly for five minutes to perfectly soften
the bread.</p>

<p><b>Beef-neck stew</b>, <a href="#Page_186">page 186</a>.</p>

<p><b>Noodles.</b> <em>Ingredients</em>, three eggs, three tablespoons
of milk or water, one teaspoon of salt, and flour.</p>

<p>Make a hole in the middle of the flour, put in the
other ingredients, and work to a stiff dough, then cut
it into four strips. Knead each till fine grained, roll
out as thin as possible, and lay the sheet aside to dry.
When all are rolled, begin with the first, cut it into
four equal pieces, lay the pieces together, one on top
of another, and shave off very fine, as you would
cabbage; pick the shavings apart with floured hands
and let them dry a little.</p>

<p><em>To use.</em> Boil the strips a few at a time in salted
water, taking them out with a skimmer, and keeping
them warm. Strew over them bread crumbs fried in
butter, or use like macaroni.</p>

<p>These noodles will keep indefinitely when dried
hard. Therefore, when eggs are cheap, they may be
made and laid up for the winter. The water in which
they are boiled is the basis of noodle soup. It needs
only the addition of a little butter, a teaspoon of
chopped parsley, and a few of the cooked noodles.</p>

<p><b>Cream-of-rice Pudding</b>, <a href="#Page_206">page 206</a>.</p>

<p><b>Browned Flour Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Cook the flour brown, in the fat over a slow fire, or
in an oven. Add slowly the water and other ingredients.
Serve with fried bread.</p>

<p><b>Toast and Cheese.</b> Toast some slices of white or
Graham bread, arrange them in a platter, and pour
over sufficient salted water to soften them. Grate over
enough old cheese to cover the toast. Set it in the
oven to melt, and place the slices together as sandwiches.
This is the simplest form of "Welsh Rarebit."</p>

under <em>all</em> circumstances. It not infrequently happens that a mother,
disregarding all indications to the contrary, will continue to nurse her
baby after it has become disastrous both to herself and the infant to do
so. If a baby remains puny, and the mother is exhausted and languid
without any known cause, it is the part of wisdom to call in the aid of
a physician, and have the milk analyzed. Good and careful feeding is
infinitely better than nursing a baby upon impoverished milk, even if
the quantity seems sufficient. A mother, in nursing her child, should
do so at stated regular intervals. If it is injurious for a grown person
to eat at odd times all day long, it is far more injurious for an infant.
It will not hurt a child to be occasionally hungry, or even to cry,
whereas it <em>will</em> hurt it seriously and perhaps induce life-long dyspepsia
if food is introduced into the stomach while there yet remains in it
that previously taken in an undigested, or partly digested, condition.
The cry which a young mother thinks indicates hunger, and hopes to
allay by feeding, is often only a dyspeptic pain, which is increased by
the very means she takes to lessen it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> In England and America many cases of scarlatina, typhoid fever,
and diphtheria have been traced to the milk supply. But there is no
satisfactory evidence that those diseases were transmitted from the
cow; more probably the milk, which is an especially good nutritive medium
for bacteria, became infected after leaving the cow. In October,
1891, an epidemic of diphtheria prevailed in Melrose, Mass. Thirty-three
cases were reported. On investigation it was found that every case
could be traced to the milk supply. The farm from which it came was
situated in an adjoining town, and the family of the dealer had been
afflicted with diphtheria, two of the children having died. The use of
the milk was, of course, promptly stopped.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> A simple and inexpensive apparatus for sterilizing milk consists
of a covered tin kettle ten inches in height by eight inches in diameter,
a wire basket, which fits easily into the kettle, supplied with
supports or legs projecting one and a half inches from the bottom, one
dozen eight-ounce nursing-bottles, and a bundle of fresh cotton wadding.
The whole apparatus, costing about $1.25, is kept in most drug
stores.
</p>
<p>
Milk for twenty-four hours' use is properly sweetened and diluted with
water in a clean pitcher, and as much of this as the child will take at
one feeding is poured into each bottle, and the bottle stopped with cotton
wadding, which should fit only moderately tight in the neck of the
bottle. The kettle is filled to the depth of one half to one inch with water,
the basket containing the bottles placed in it, the kettle covered and
placed over a fire until the steam comes out from the sides of the top for
half an hour, when the basket containing the bottles should be removed
and put in a cool place. When the milk is to be used, it should be heated
by placing a bottle in warm water for a few minutes. The cotton is
then removed, and a sterilized nipple attached. After the feeding the
bottle is cleansed and kept in an inverted position until used again.
The above directions are those of Dr. Booker, specialist of children's
diseases, Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_61_61" id="Footnote_61_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> In the Walker-Gordon Milk Laboratory, in Boston, milk is sterilized
at 175° to 180° Fahr. for fifteen minutes, and it is claimed that this
temperature gives the best results for milk to be used within twenty-four
hours. If the milk has to be kept a longer time, a higher temperature
is necessary, as only the bacteria and not the spores are destroyed by
175° Fahr.
</p>
<p>
Machines are in use in France which will heat great quantities of milk
to about 155° Fahr. and then rapidly cool it. Not all, but nearly all,
forms of bacteria likely to be found in milk are destroyed at the temperature
of 155°, and the good flavor of the milk is not injured. Such
milk is known as <em>Pasteurized milk</em>.</p></div>

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
